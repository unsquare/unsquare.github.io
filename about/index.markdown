Smooth Few Films consists of Daniel, Nick, and Eddy. They are based in Houston, Texas, and are lovers of all things related to movies, games, and machinima. While each has his own role to fill on the crew, (Nick as editor, Daniel as Director, and Eddy as Creator and Writer), nothing would happen without the collaboration of everyone on board. Though none of them are currently full-time filmmakers (not by choice), they hold degrees in Film and Creative Writing, and love to both entertain and create. Coincidentally, Smooth Few Films was the gag name the trio used for a project filmed in high school known as "Spoonfed".

**The Leet World**

The story of The Leet World begins in 2004. Eddy, while off in the land of Flore Da, was inspired by the rise of machinima. It had been an idea several years previous to make a funny video using Counter-Strike, but never had it occurred that someone could make a web series. Obsessed with this phenomenon, he crafted the first draft of a script that was filmed by him and Daniel that October, never to see the light of day.

Alas, it sucked. But the idea lingered. The original idea of "The Show" (which did not have a name), was that two Counter-Terrorists were going to be on the trail of two known Terrorists. The CT portion of the show would run like "Law and Order", a criminal investigation, and the T portion of the show would be like a reality series, featuring terrorists living together in a house. After a few first drafts, it became apparent that the T portion of the show was clearly funnier, and then a conclusion was reached- instead of making a sitcom (that was, let's face it, a rip off of every other machinima out there), let's make a reality show, set in Counter-Strike.

Terrorists and Counter-Terrorists would live in a house together, performing challenges against one another. The characters would be both parodies of the typical reality show archetypes, as well as the archetypes of the kinds of nutty individuals you meet while playing CS. A list of characters was formed, and a pilot episode was written. The problem, though, was that Daniel, Nick, and Eddy all lived in separate places. The idea was dropped in early 2005, to be resumed at a later date.

After several more drafts, attempts at filming crappy pilot episodes (maybe one day they'll be posted... but wow, they're bad), and a few moves, all three members of Smooth Few Films found themselves back in Houston, with a script for a trailer that they were all reasonably happy with, but more importantly, several episodes that they were dying to make. The trailer was filmed and released in June 2007, and work began on The Leet World, as we know it.
