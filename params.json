  "body": "Hi, I'm Jeff James! In my spare time, I am a writer.\r\n\r\nI've written episodes of both [Web Zeroes][wz] and [The Leet World][tlw] for my friends at [Smooth Few Films][sff]. We're currently hard at work on a long-awaited third season of The Leet World. I am also developing some scripts of my own.\r\n\r\nIn October of 2012, the now-defunct Kazka Press published my story [Burning Love][bl]. I have a few new stories in various stages, including one that has gone through a few rounds of submissions (and rejections).\r\n\r\nI write about books at [Full of Words][fow], and about video game at [GamerSushi][gs], which still publishes the occasional post. I love nothing more than a good bit of critical analysis and intelligent discussion, and do my best to bring those skills to all my work.\r\n\r\nI do the occasional web development work, and I am the webmaster for both [Smooth Few Films][sff] and [GamerSushi][gs]. I have extensive experience with the [WordPress][wp] platform, but decided to convert my personal website to run on [Jekyll][jk]. Figuring out how to use a static site generator was definitely an interesting challenge.\r\n\r\nIf you'd like to get in touch, you can find me on [Facebook][fb], [Twitter][tw], [Tumblr][tum] and even [Google][g]. My email address is available upon request if you have a burning need. To keep up with what I'm reading, look me up on [Goodreads][gr]. I read a lot.\r\n\r\n[wz]: http://smoothfewfilms.com/webzeroes/\r\n[tlw]: http://smoothfewfilms.com/theleetworld/\r\n[sff]: http://smoothfewfilms.com\r\n[bl]: http://unsquare.com/portfolio/writing/burning-love/\r\n[fow]: http://fullofwords.com\r\n[gs]: http://gamersushi.com\r\n[wp]: http://wordpress.org\r\n[fb]: http://facebook.com/unsquare\r\n[tum]: http://unsquare.tumblr.com\r\n[tw]: http://twitter.com/unsquare\r\n[g]: https://plus.google.com/+JeffJamesUnsquare\r\n[gr]: http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/147668-jeff-james\r\n[jk]: http://jekyllrb.com",
