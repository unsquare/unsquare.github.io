        <p>Hi, I'm Jeff James! In my spare time, I am a writer.</p>

<p>I've written episodes of both <a href="http://smoothfewfilms.com/webzeroes/">Web Zeroes</a> and <a href="http://smoothfewfilms.com/theleetworld/">The Leet World</a> for my friends at <a href="http://smoothfewfilms.com">Smooth Few Films</a>. We're currently hard at work on a long-awaited third season of The Leet World. I am also developing some scripts of my own.</p>

<p>In October of 2012, the now-defunct Kazka Press published my story <a href="http://unsquare.com/portfolio/writing/burning-love/">Burning Love</a>. I have a few new stories in various stages, including one that has gone through a few rounds of submissions (and rejections).</p>

<p>I write about books at <a href="http://fullofwords.com">Full of Words</a>, and about video game at <a href="http://gamersushi.com">GamerSushi</a>, which still publishes the occasional post. I love nothing more than a good bit of critical analysis and intelligent discussion, and do my best to bring those skills to all my work.</p>

<p>I do the occasional web development work, and I am the webmaster for both <a href="http://smoothfewfilms.com">Smooth Few Films</a> and <a href="http://gamersushi.com">GamerSushi</a>. I have extensive experience with the <a href="http://wordpress.org">WordPress</a> platform, but decided to convert my personal website to run on <a href="http://jekyllrb.com">Jekyll</a>. Figuring out how to use a static site generator was definitely an interesting challenge.</p>

<p>If you'd like to get in touch, you can find me on <a href="http://facebook.com/unsquare">Facebook</a>, <a href="http://twitter.com/unsquare">Twitter</a>, <a href="http://unsquare.tumblr.com">Tumblr</a> and even <a href="https://plus.google.com/+JeffJamesUnsquare">Google</a>. My email address is available upon request if you have a burning need. To keep up with what I'm reading, look me up on <a href="http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/147668-jeff-james">Goodreads</a>. I read a lot.</p>
