**Who are you guys?**

Nick Comardo, Daniel Miller and Eddy Rivas did all of the production work. Jace Ford made the music, and Jeff James was the webmaster. Head on over to the [about page](http://www.smoothfewfilms.com/about/) for more info.

**Are you working on anything new right now?**

No. Smooth Few Films is currently on indefinite hiatus.

**Will there be a third season of The Leet World?
**

No. The Leet World story is complete.

**If I send you money, will you make a third season of The Leet World?**

Please see above.

**What about a Leet World movie? Is that still happening?
**

No, there will not be a Leet World movie.

**Whatever happened to G.R.I.E.F., the Halo machinima you announced in 2008?**

Unfortunately, we never got the time to make G.R.I.E.F., and it was quickly moved to the back burner. We don't currently have any plans to resurrect it.

**How long did episodes of The Leet World take to make?**

It changed from episode to episode, depending on the complexity of shots and how many set-ups there were, but it averaged a few weeks. This was why we were never able to keep to a set schedule.

**Can I buy The Leet World on DVD?**

No. We do not have a license from Valve, and we have confirmed that they are not interested in licensing for machinima. If anyone tries to sell you a Leet World DVD, or if you see one on eBay or another auction site, please don't buy the DVD - not only is it illegal, that person is trying to profit off of our hard work.

Jace did all of the music for our shows, except for the remix of the theme song used in Episode 14, season 1 of The Leet World. That was done by a contest-winner. Every single other piece was one of his original compositions.

**Where can I download the Leet World theme song?**

[Here](http://www.smoothfewfilms.com/audio/tlw_theme.mp3).

**Hey, do you guys need any storage space or bandwidth?**

Thanks, but no. This is something we'd like to manage ourselves, and right now we have plenty.

**I have a great idea for an episode. Wanna hear it?**

Please don't send us your ideas, because we won't read them. It's a legal thing, guys. We don't want to get accused of plagiarism if an episode happens to be similar to your idea. We also have very specific ideas of where we want to take our shows, and we aren't looking for story ideas from other places.

**Do you need interns? Are you hiring?**

We are a very small production company working on zero budget. All of us still have day jobs to pay the bills. We don't have the resources to hire outside people.

**Can I be a voice actor or extra? Can I volunteer to help in some way?
**

No, we are not looking for outside voice actors or extras. We are also not looking for volunteers. If there ever is a time when we need outside help, we will post on the blog or in the forums. We love that so many people are enthusiastic about our shows, but the best way to use that enthusiasm is to turn around and come up with your own idea for a show and start producing it.

**Did you use GMod/etc. to make The Leet World?**

The show was primarily shot in Counter-Strike Source.  GMod was used for things like logs falling from trees.
**
