Hi, I'm Jeff James! In my spare time, I am a writer.

I've written episodes of both [Web Zeroes][wz] and [The Leet World][tlw] for my friends at [Smooth Few Films][sff]. We're currently hard at work on a long-awaited third season of The Leet World. I am also developing some scripts of my own.

In October of 2012, the now-defunct Kazka Press published my story [Burning Love][bl]. I have a few new stories in various stages, including one that has gone through a few rounds of submissions (and rejections).

I write about books at [Full of Words][fow], and about video game at [GamerSushi][gs], which still publishes the occasional post. I love nothing more than a good bit of critical analysis and intelligent discussion, and do my best to bring those skills to all my work.

I do the occasional web development work, and I am the webmaster for both [Smooth Few Films][sff] and [GamerSushi][gs]. I have extensive experience with the [WordPress][wp] platform, but decided to convert my personal website to run on [Jekyll][jk]. Figuring out how to use a static site generator was definitely an interesting challenge.

If you'd like to get in touch, you can find me on [Facebook][fb], [Twitter][tw], [Tumblr][tum] and even [Google][g]. My email address is available upon request if you have a burning need. To keep up with what I'm reading, look me up on [Goodreads][gr]. I read a lot.
