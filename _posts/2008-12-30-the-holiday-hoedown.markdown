Well here we are, another year down, and a new one upon us. We thought we'd send 2008 off with a bang, so we brought a kingly gift- The Leet World Holiday Special, redux.

In this edition, The Leet World characters run down their favorite things about the holidays. I think it's a mighty good time. I hope you guys enjoy it, and remember, it's a part of [One Shared Vision](http://www.onesharedvision.com/), the machinima movement to promote [Child's Play](http://www.childsplaycharity.org). I'd definitely encourage you guys to look into Child's Play, as it's a rockin' charity for gamers.

Speaking of video games, I hope you guys got a bunch of them for Christmas. I got Chrono Trigger DS, myself.

By the way, if you're looking for some good entertainment at 7pm Eastern on Tuesday, December 30th, then check out [Halo Community Live](http://www.mogulus.com/halocommunitylive). It's a live broadcast of several machinimas from the Halo community including TheDuoGroup, Halo 3 Mythbusters, and more. Unfortunately, we couldn't participate because of late notice, but I'd definitely recommend checking it out.

Anywho, our new video is after the jump!

Enjoy!
