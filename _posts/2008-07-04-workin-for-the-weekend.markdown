Everybody's doing it. Well, specifically, Nick and I are doing it.

Unfortunately, with Daniel gone, part 3 of the Finale is taking longer than it was originally going to, meaning that it's going to get pushed to next week. With the three-day weekend because of Will Smith Day (some would call it Independence Day), we really want to take advantage of that extra time and make sure that this final video of the Season is the way that it should be. Anytime sooner and it just wouldn't be up to par.

Believe me, if anyone is disappointed, it's us, because we were gunning to get all three parts up when we said we would. However, all of that was said before we went down a man, and as Chet would say, shit's changed. Sorry dudes. But know that the finale will be better for it.

For you fellow Americans, don't get too crazy tomorrow and blow off any of your fingers.
