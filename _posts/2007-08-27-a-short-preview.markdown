Well, Episode Three is currently underway, and should be released next week.  We're pretty pumped about this one, because it leads directly into Episode Four, which is going to be Ah-Maze-Zing (we hope).  In other news, we are being featured on a cool gaming and videos website called [GamingTv](http://www.gamingtv.us), so go check out their content.

And below is a trailer for Episode Three.  Enjoy.
