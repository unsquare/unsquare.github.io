![Techstrogen](http://smoothfewfilms.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/wz116.jpg)It's Wednesday, so that means it's time for a new episode of Web Zeroes. No, this isn't an April Fool's joke this time, we promise. 

Episode 16 of our goofy series, [Techstrogen](http://smoothfewfilms.com/2010/04/06/techstrogen/), is now available to be viewed and/or torn apart by all of you swell folks. In this episode, the guys attempt to make a show starring with their new hire, Amy. Also, Alex skips work.

I'm a really big fan of this episode. I know I'm supposed to say that about everything we do, but there are always some things that tend to grab me more than others, and this episode does it for me. In addition to introducing several new characters, it also has some of Jace's best work in terms of the music. But I guess I should stop talking and let you be the judge. You judgers.

Hit the jump and judge away.
