Wow, the full line-up for [PAX](http://pennyarcadeexpo.com/) was posted today at Kotaku, and [it's a doozy](http://kotaku.com/5019938/everyone-and-the-ecto+1-heading-to-pax). It's cool for us because we're thinking about going. And if the ECTO-1 is there, I'm all about it. If you're not aware, PAX is a video game expo put on by the dudes at [Penny Arcade](http://www.penny-arcade.com), and it's supposed to rule.

Next week, we'll be making some fun announcements. Be here.

Oh, and Part Two will be up tomorrow morning. And no, refreshing your browser all night won't make it come any sooner, you crazy nutters.

After this, all that's left is Part Three. Wild.
