The wait is finally over!  We now present Episode Nine, "[Satisfaction Guaranteed](http://www.smoothfewfilms.com/2008/02/01/satisfaction-guaranteed/)".  Over the last month, we've taken some time to look at the next half of season one, and how to help improve on the next batch of episodes.  We've even started looking forward to the future.  I think you guys will like what's in store down the road for The Leet World, and from Smooth Few Films in general.
