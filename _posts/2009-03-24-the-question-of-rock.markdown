![electric-guitar](http://smoothfewfilms.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/electric-guitar.jpg)Episode 7 is nearing the final stages. We feel like we have scaled some kind of beastly machinima mountain. No, this doesn't mean the episode is coming any minute now, because there's quite a bit that has to get done to it before it's ready for your calloused videogamer paws, but it's close, and I'm excited.

One of the coolest parts of doing The Leet World is getting to hear the awesome stuff that Mr. Jace Ford, aka Damn Dangerous, pumps out for us every new episode. To watch the process go from a script to a final cut with his music put into it for the first time really is something special. The dude works hard to score each episode, and usually only does so in about a week's time. 

Anywho, over the course of the show we've seen tons of great comments regarding the music, so I wanted to know- which episode of The Leet World has your favorite music? I couldn't quite put that in a poll since there would be way too many options, so feel free to respond in the comments.
