![eight](http://smoothfewfilms.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/04/eight.jpg)Production on Season 2, Episode 8 is rolling along pretty smoothly. It's always funny when we do a big monster episode like [Tempest](http://smoothfewfilms.com/2009/03/28/tempest/) and then things settle down a bit, making the episode much easier to film. The episode itself is going to be a shorter one, but that doesn't mean it's not chock full of goodness.

Sometime in the next few days you should expect some outtakes from Episodes 5-7. They will contain a couple of rofls, I hope. While we have gotten better about recording our stuff without many goof-ups, it's three episodes worth of content, so it should balance out.

Also, here are some screenshots from Episode 8 for you to chew on.

Enjoy!
