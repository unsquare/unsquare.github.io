![Maybe I Steal?](http://smoothfewfilms.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/steal.jpg)Web Zeroes Season 2 is debuting this upcoming Wednesday, March 24th, which I'm hoping you guys have gathered courtesy of the last couple of blog posts. The first episode picks up a bit after the finale of Season 1, showing some of the aftermath of that episode's zaniness. And it only gets weirder from there.

As I've said a million times, we can't wait for this debut. I think all around, we learned a lot from last season, and really started to hit our stride in the second half. I'd like to think we're not only picking up the story where we left it off, but the pace and tone of the show as well. Also, I love the look of the new camera. Kind of sweet. Hopefully all of you will agree.

This blog post's title is borrowed from one of our favorite Leet World quotes, which is something that I've been thinking about ever since [this awesome trailer](http://smoothfewfilms.com/2010/03/12/a-dose-of-nostalgia/) that we linked last week. While it may seem a bit vain of us, we are quite fond of quoting our own material. I'm guessing that some of the stuff we like to joke around about differs from some of the things you guys do, so I thought I'd find out.

There are plenty more to add to this list at a later date, but here are some of our favorite quotes/moments...

<!-- more -->

**"Mebby I Steal" - TLW Season 1, Ep 9**
Episode 9 was written by our good man Jeff James, who has also written a few other episodes of our goofy shows. Daniel, Nick and I added the bit of Player trying to steal the snowman's hat while we were shooting it, and "mebby I steal" became a regular quote amongst all of us. For some reason it was hilarious to us because we imagined Player saying it so shiftily to himself. 



**"Peeing is nice" - TLW Season 1, Ep 8**
Daniel loves to quote Ahmad and Cortez's awkward bathroom conversation for epic lulz. Seriously, he does this all the time.

**"How make man Leet World?" - Fan question on YouTube**
Not from anything we've done, but still hilarious in its own way. I know the guy probably doesn't speak English, but we all ask each other this question about random things now. Like sandwiches and movies.

**Bad East European accents - Web Zeroes, Ep 2**
Alex's slew of movie quotes in the Niko Bellic voice gave rise to an inside joke that has morphed like crazy over the last few months. It turned into us quoting movies all the time in this ridiculous voice, and now results in Daniel saying in a Russian accent that in his home country, he is "very premium" at things he is good at. It is probably not that funny to anyone else but us.

So what about you guys? What are some of your favorite quotes from Leet World, Web Zeroes, or some of our shorts?
