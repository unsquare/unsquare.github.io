Well, here's the second edition of The Leet World podcast, where we talk about the show, some of your questions, and a few VERY nerdy things (you'll have to listen to find out). We recorded it a little over a week ago, the day before Episode Six came out. If for no other reason, at least check it out to hear Damn Dangerous's alternate "podcast version" of The Leet World theme-tune. It's wonderful.

A few things will become clear when you listen to this... mainly, that we know way too much about TV. And Daniel and Nick are way too into tech.

Also, playing on the server with some of you dudes yesterday was swell. Hope to see more of you guys on there.
