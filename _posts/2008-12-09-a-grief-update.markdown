So if you haven't guessed already, G.R.I.E.F. is on hold indefinitely. Now that we're working hard on Web Zeroes and The Leet World, adding one more thing into the mix is going to bring down the quality of all of the projects. We are but mere men after all, though I am somewhere close to troll-ish in nature.

We've filmed part of the first episode, but it's a very ambitious endeavor, so we're just going to stick it on the backburner until we find some time for it. Who knows, maybe our new TLW method rocks our socks off and we have all kinds of free time to make Halo 3 machinima in addition to our other stuff. And play video games.

We're also hard at work on Episode 3 of The Leet World, filming and doing all kinds of Counter-Strike things. Episode 2 is coming sometime in the next week, and I think you dudes will enjoy it. Web Zeroes short in the next few days.

Prepare for lulz in 3...2...
