![](http://smoothfewfilms.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/09/nate1.jpg)We're excited to announce that Web Zeroes is coming next month to Revision3! 

For some of you, the cat has already been out of the bag since the newest episode of [Diggnation](http://revision3.com/diggnation/trailertease?hp) aired last night, but the rest of you can still be surprised. If you're unaware, Rev3 is the king of awesome Internet television content like Totally Rad Show, Film Riot, Co-Op and then some. Those of you that already watch their stuff can easily attest to that.

As for our show, this is going to be a slightly rebooted version of Web Zeroes, hence the removal of the episodes from our site. I can't go into a whole lot of detail about it just yet, but for now, you should go watch the new [Web Zeroes trailer](http://revision3.com/webzeroes) over at Revision3! This is a huge opportunity that we're extremely pumped about. We can't wait to show you what we've been working on.

[Go watch the trailer](http://revision3.com/webzeroes)!
