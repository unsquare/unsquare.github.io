We now present [Episode Eight of The Leet World, "If it Bleeds"](http://www.smoothfewfilms.com/2007/12/21/if-it-bleeds/).  This marks the halfway point of our season and is the midseason finale, of sorts.  We'll be taking a few weeks off from making episodes to get ready for the next half of the season, and taking some steps to ensure that the show just gets better and better.  But, as always, there will be plenty of extra treats for you guys over the next few weeks, as we'll have time to get some cool bonus content on here.  And I promise you you'll want to look at it.  Trust me.
