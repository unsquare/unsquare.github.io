![machinima](http://smoothfewfilms.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/machinima.jpg)Even though we're not making so much machinima anymore here at Smooth Few Films, it doesn't deter my interest in it. I still like to scour and search for what's new out there in the wide world of video game movie-making, just to see what other people are doing and what games they're using. 

Oddly enough, it doesn't seem that any game has made as big of a splash for the machinima community as Halo 3 did back in 2007. It's crazy to me that it's just over 2 years later, and we're still waiting on the next engine to come and revitalize amateur filmmakers to try out some of their own stuff. Uncharted 2 just dropped for the PS3, and it has some machinima tools hidden within its depths, if only you can make it past the incredible single player campaign (and trust me, it is quite incredible). I also hear that Dragon Age: Origins coming out next month will make use of some rather robust tools.

In terms of some of the new things I'm seeing out there that hold promise, a couple of things come to mind. [Red Vs Blue Recreation](http://redvsblue.com/archive/?id=738) once again sets the standard for awesomeness. SgtPadrino has some remarkable [Call of Duty](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=22jHUoN6OKI) videos that he's been scripting together, and they're impressive as anything I've seen in recent months. Likewise, [Mystfit](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WyuM65dctBs) continues to work away on some custom TF2 animations. Can't wait to see what the results of those experiments are. Running Gun (creators of Spriggs) are steadily releasing a fully scripted Fallout 3 machinima called [JudgeMental](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zY3vzQ4Yvfo). And then there's good old Darkspire Films, who just released the [Candy Coated Wonder Road](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o8uWPyutQnI), a Halo 3 children's show.

So what do you guys think the state of machinima is? What are some of your favorite machinimas out there right now? 

Also, Web Zeroes Episode 3 hits tomorrow, and some new TLW outtakes should be up later this week- hope to see you back for both of those!
