If you haven't played the Force Unleashed demo yet, go do so. It's everything I've always wanted in a Star Wars game. And in real life.

Speaking of games, I thought I'd update and let you guys know that our new gaming blog should hopefully be up and running soon. We've got some other great writers on board, so it'll be a good time once it's kicking.

Also, the GRIEF trailer is scheduled to make its debut this weekend, and if not then, early next week. It's very trailer-ish.

And lastly, a small concept screenshot of the title sequence Daniel is working on for Web Zeroes. This is an earlier mock-up, so the final will look different from this in terms of some design tweaks, just wanted to give you guys a little peak at the process:
