![mgs](http://smoothfewfilms.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/mgs.jpg)Here's Episode 11 of Season 2, [Death's Dungeon](http://smoothfewfilms.com/2009/06/24/deaths-dungeon/), and boy are we getting close to the finish line. Only two more episodes left for the season.

In this chapter, we find out what Leeroy has been up to since he left the house, and finally get some answers regarding the greater mystery surrounding the Producer. Leeroy's very Solid Snake about it, too. Check it out on the [TLW premiere page](http://www.smoothfewfilms.com/premiere) to see a bigger version, and for the love of all things holy, clear your cache if you're seeing the old video still.

If that's not your cup of tea, though, you can just hit up the jump to see the regular version.

This starts the last arc, and the final tumble towards the conclusion of The Leet World as a series. Episode 12 should be out in a couple of weeks, with Episode 13 acting as our epic finale for the season. 

Much thanks go to Lord Ned for doing some Hammer stuff for us this episode, Tyler from [Forecast](http://forecasttheseries.blogspot.com/), and Jace for continuing to rock it out for the music. Loving all the orchestrated stuff. I kind of want to marry him.

Enjoy!
