Hi dudes, just bringing you a present in the form of the first Smooth Few Films podcast concerning "The Leet World". Not sure how many of you are into podcasts, but we had a fun time recording it (as you'll no doubt hear). We talk about a variety of things from the show, to gaming, to television. Not bad for a trial run. We'd like to eventually turn this into a forum for us to talk about media, technology- pretty much all things nerdy. Also, in the future, we'll possibly be taking questions from you guys that you'd like us to talk about, as far as the show goes.

Give it a listen!
