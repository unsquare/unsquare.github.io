![russia](http://smoothfewfilms.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/04/russia.jpg)We now present Episode 8 of Season 2 of The Leet World, [Hide and Sneak](http://smoothfewfilms.com/2009/04/30/hide-and-sneak/). This episode starts to get the ball rolling for the second half of the season, which is about to pick up like a freight train. A freight train made of win.

In this episode, we see the house operating under some new dynamics, and the effects of Leeroy's departure from several sides. Also, there are lulz. Anywho, check the [TLW Premiere page](http://www.smoothfewfilms.com/premiere) to see a high-res version of the episode. Clear your browser cache if you're still getting the old video. 

See the new ep after the jump!

I'd like to give a special shout out to our webmaster Jeff (better known as JJ around these parts) for writing this episode. As I've said before, we divided this Season into 4 distinct arcs, each consisting of 3-4 episodes apiece. We are now on the third arc of the show, which Jeff is lending his expert penmanship to. He also wrote episodes 9 and 13 of Season One.

Also, as always, thanks to Jace (AKA Damn Dangerous) for the killer tunes. He always surprises me with each song, and seriously, listening to the music is one of the most exciting parts of each episode before we release it. We've easily got the best music in a machinima series. By a mile. Give him props and double props, plz.

Enjoy!
