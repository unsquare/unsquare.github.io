Ever needed a weapon desperately, only to be told by the retailer that you couldn't buy one without a pre-order? Or perhaps you keep wondering where all of the mom-and-pop gun and ammo stores went to? Then perhaps you're familiar with GunStop, the dominant weapons retailer on XBox Live. This is a short filmed with the Halo 3 engine. For all you gamers that have had the pleasure of dealing with the store that is being parodied in this video, we trust that you can relate to some of the experiences inside.
