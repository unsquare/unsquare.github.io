I promised a treat for everyone that continued to check our website. And that treat is now.

One of our goals for The Leet World is to be a site that is constantly delivering content. Sometimes that will be just through updating our blog, but we think that's a little boring. I'm talking about things like screenshots, behind-the-scenes footage, special videos, and even audio outtakes, which is what I'm posting right now.

Now, as I said before, this is just a nice little treat for you guys- it probably won't happen every episode. But, rest assured, if you come check this page out a couple of times a week, you'll always have something to look forward to.

So, if it tickles your fancy (and if it tickles anything else I don't want to know), check out our Episode One audio outtakes:
