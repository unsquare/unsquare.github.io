It seems the trailer has put people in a bit of a frenzy.  Always nice.

In case you're unaware (meaning that you didn't pay attention to the credits), Episode Nine had a guest writer: our long-time friend and excellent webmaster, Jeff (unsquare for those of you on the forums).  I typically write out the scripts for each episode, which can be a tiring process over the course of a season- so I was definitely excited when Jeff started showing an interest in writing an episode for us a few months ago.  He's one of the more talented writers I know, so that was certainly a bonus, too.

Anywho, Jeff has written an article about the process of writing the episode for us, and I must say it's a good read, especially for those of you who are interested in how the show is put together.  Read it: [Jeff's article about The Leet World](http://unsquare.com/dance/2008/02/14/so-i-actually-wrote-something/).

On another note, please don't start sending us scripts for episodes of The Leet World- we're fine, thanks.

More updates: 1)Two more screenshots of Episode Ten can be viewed below.  2)The Halo short should be here in the next couple of days.
