I've been promising some announcements for several weeks now, so I figured it was time to stand and deliver. I'm no Lou Diamond Phillips, but I think I'll be ok. Also, you may want to read on to see an interesting tidbit about part 3 of the Season Finale.

Here's the stuff in the works...

  * **The Leet World Season One Soundtrack**. Sometime after the release of the Season Finale, we'll finally be adding a section to our website for you to purchase a soundtrack inspired by music from our first season of The Leet World. Jace has been hard at work on this for a bit now, and is choosing a number of his favorite tunes from the course of the season to re-record and fill out as full songs, rather than the 20-30 second bits you hear in the show. We can't talk details of pricing and such as of yet, but rest assured, it will be reasonable. And trust me, it'll be worth every penny. Besides, if you just want one song, you can buy it individually.

	
  * **G.R.I.E.F. **This is a short Halo mini-series that we plan on doing a few episodes of. I don't want to say too much about what the actual concept is, but it's essentially a parody of super-hero teams and should make for a good time. Lots of action, lots of comedy.

	
  * **Web Zeroes. **Our pride and joy. A live action mockumentary starring Smooth Few Films, filmed in HD. That's all I'll say at the moment. We're extremely excited about this.

	
  * **New sites! **While we enjoy our website and value the way it's been able to carry us through the season, it really is kind of busting at the seams, mainly because we didn't anticipate the kind of use it would be seeing after just one year's time. A re-design is already in the works for this site, as well as a brand new site that will act as the Smooth Few Films hub for all of our projects.


So there you have it. Some of these things are a bit off, and some of them are rather close, but I really wanted to put this out there before Season One was over, so you know that more stuff is coming from Smooth Few Films during the gap between seasons. There will also be some Leet World related shorts (think the Christmas special) that I can't talk about too much without giving stuff away.

Part 3 of the Finale is coming in a few days. If you're wondering why it's taking longer than we thought, word on the street is that it's nearing 18 minutes in length. Wow.

EDIT: By the way, tomorrow's my birthday. Big 25.
