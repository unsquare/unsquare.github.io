[![Question block](http://smoothfewfilms.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/question.jpg)](http://smoothfewfilms.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/question.jpg)Man, it's been quiet around here lately, eh? Since Web Zeroes ended a few weeks ago, the wheels have been turning a bit slow around the SFF wagon, but that doesn't mean they've stopped altogether. The biggest and most frequently asked question that we've seen in the last month or so has been: what's next? I wanted to answer for that you guys as best as I could so you know that we haven't hitched a ride on dragons out of the country or something.

The short of it is this: we're not quite sure what's next. That's not for a lack of ideas at all. In fact, we actually have a surplus of them. The tricky part is narrowing it down, which will only come with time to weight out their pros and cons, and also time to chill out a bit. For real, we're just starting to get used to having our weekends back for the first time in several years, and we're going to enjoy that for a bit before we throw ourselves onto the content skillet again. It is a hot and buttery place. OK, that metaphor got kind of weird.

Anyway, the only thing I can really tell you is this. Our next ideas aren't exactly small potatoes. They're big. Orca fat, I guess you could say. Up until now, we've done everything without a budget and without a huge supply of time. Everything has been quick, free and dirty. The last episode of Web Zeroes is something we were able to throw a bunch of time at, and I think the effort really shows. As a result, we're going to make sure that whatever we do next we tackle with both time and money. Just think: if we've pulled off the stuff we've done so far without a budget or ample time, it's tough to imagine what we could do with just a little of both. Or a lot of both, which would be preferable. 

And no, these do not include TLW. In conjunction with wanting to do our next project with the aforementioned time and money, we also want to be able to own it. TLW is the opposite of that, [as we've discussed on many a fine occasion](http://smoothfewfilms.com/2010/01/24/the-problem-with-machinima/).

So, stay tuned. I promise more info is coming, along with regular updates. Some things that we're hoping to have on the docket in the next few weeks include more lost TLW factoids, some Web Zeroes features and other cool things I can't say just yet.

In other machinima news, have you seen this [Gears of War 3 trailer](http://gamersushi.com/2010/07/28/machinima-gears-of-war-3-what-have-i-become/) created by a variety of producers including [The Duo Group](http://www.theduogroup.com/), Treadster Media, Kootra and Sound Wizardry. I love it.

Discuss, gents.
