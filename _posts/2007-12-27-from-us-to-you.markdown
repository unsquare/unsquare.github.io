Just like I promised, I have arrived this morning bearing gifts!  Well, one gift to be exact.  The Leet World Holiday Special!  It's a card, from us to you.  Try to imagine it in an envelope in your mailbox.  Sure, it's a couple of days late, but I doubt there will be much complaining about that.  Give it a watch.  Share it with your friends.
