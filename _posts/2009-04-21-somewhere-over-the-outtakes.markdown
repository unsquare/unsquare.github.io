![mic2](http://smoothfewfilms.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/04/mic2.jpg)That's where the lulz live.

Here are the audio outtakes from Episodes 5 and 6 of Season 2. I was going to include 7, but to be honest, there was plenty of goofy material for me to use, so Episodes 7 and 8 will be lumped together in a couple of weeks.

As always, lots of us goofing around in our absurd character voices, some movie quotes, and even some singing numbers to boot. In particular, I'm a fan of Ben discovering the "investigating each other's privates" line as he's reading it, and instantly cracking up. Many of you don't know this, but the dude actually delivers his lines cold, with no prior knowledge of the script, which makes his voice work doubly impressive if you ask me.

Anyways, here are the outtakes. Right click and select "save as" to download.

In other news, Episode 8 is coming out next week. Wewt.
