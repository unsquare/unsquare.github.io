![wow](http://smoothfewfilms.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/wow.jpg)We now present Episode 9 of Web Zeroes, [Intervention](http://smoothfewfilms.com/2009/12/02/intervention/). In this episode, Ray gets addicted to World of Warcraft, and Nate and Alex have to go to exotic lengths to bring their friend back to reality.

As many of you who saw the original videos can guess, this is a spin on an old idea. We thought it would be more interesting to see Ray out of his element, since he's kind of the glue that holds the entire ship together. I think there are some hilarious results.

We're starting to enter the last leg of the season, which is more than a little wild. In fact, we've almost got filmed up through Episode 12, and we'll be working on Episode 13 (the finale) a little this week in Austin. Web Zeroes really is an entirely different experience from Leet World, one that I'll have to write more about at a later time.

For now, hit the jump to see the episode!

Much thanks go to Ty in this episode for his work as Bobby King. The table scene is one of my favorite we've done. As we've said before, spread the word to people you know, and tell them about our show. To download the episode, visit [Revision3](http://www.revision3.com/webzeroes/intervention/). 

I know the activity has been kind of sparse around these parts lately, but I plan on changing that shortly. We've got some cool content planned for the next few weeks. 

Enjoy!
