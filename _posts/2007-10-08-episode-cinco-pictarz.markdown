Well, filming on Episode Five finally commenced over the weekend, and after a few audio/video snags, we were able to get the train that is The Leet World moving again.  What's funny about doing Episode Five is that after how complex the last episode was, this one feels like a breeze.  It was also strange looking at the script as we were about to do the audio, because it was filled with just so much dialogue.  That's pretty different from the script of "Dust 2 Dust", which pretty much had just a few lines of dialogue constantly being interrupted with "they fight".

So for those of you who enjoyed "Dust 2 Dust", but really are hoping that the departure isn't permanent, don't worry- the challenge episodes are just there to mix things up a little bit at different points in the show's life, as well as helping to resolve little plot arcs.  Think of them as PPV events in the WWE.  Sounds silly, but it's a fairly decent analogy for the situation.


Here are some screenies for Episode Five.  You might find a couple of the locales intriguing...  Hope you enjoy.  Please donate.
