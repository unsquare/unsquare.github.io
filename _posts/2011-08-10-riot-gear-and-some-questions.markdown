I've decided I'm going to start updating this blogernator a bit more. But as we don't have many updates, I figured I could use it to answer some questions. So from here on out, feel free to ask away in the comments, and I'll do my best. If you're an aspiring content creator, I'd love for this to be a place where you can get some advice from some guys who have been there and back and have the scars and torn up contracts to prove it.

Our first round of answers:

1) We still got lots of questions about Season 3 of Leet World. This kind of surprises me, because as much as I know people loved the show, it has in fact been over for 2 years. People have done some pretty cool things on the Internet since then, and I highly recommend checking some of them out. Such as this nifty [Portal 2 machinima](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HZDf_hpPV4). The writing's not fantastic, but I'm impressed with what they pulled off, technically speaking. And there's always [Red Vs Blue](http://redvsblue.com/), which has gone into a stratosphere that no other machinima creators can hope to touch.

2) If you ask us if _you_ can be the one to continue Leet World, my answer will always be that nobody can stop you from doing what you want, but you're not going to get our blessing. I'd encourage you to make your own thing, in your own way. Because I'm tyrannical like that.

3) All of us have recently rewatched The Leet World for the first time in a very, very long time, and I've got to say... I'm still baffled we did it. There's a lot of technical stuff going on in a lot of those scenes that a lot of effort went into, and in some ways nobody can ever truly appreciate it but us. Weird to think that we pulled it off with all of the hurtles we had to overcome.

4) Not to make light of a serious situation, But I think Player is ready for the London riots. Seriously though, stay safe out there you guys.
