I'd like to thank everyone for the encouraging words regarding our announcement about [the end of TLW](http://smoothfewfilms.com/2009/04/23/the-curtain-closes/) after this season (and an awesome movie). We've been suspecting that this might go down for a couple of months, but it only became set in stone recently. It's good to have it out in the open, and even better when nobody goes ballistic and throws things at us. You know, like e-rocks.

Since the questions are rolling in, I wanted to clarify a few things:



	
  * Daniel is not leaving yet. He actually won't be gone for about 5 months or so. In that time our goal is to finish the season, party like man-imals, and then make a sweet movie. We don't know how long the movie will be, minutes-wise.

	
  * The show is not over yet. We're still going to do the second half of the season. For those of you wondering, it will be just a bit shorter than last season. 

	
  * Without Daniel, we won't be continuing Web Zeroes regularly. Since he's kind of in it and also the director, there's no way it could happen. We'd still like to do an episode or two before he goes, and there might be an occasional episode if he comes in town for a weekend, but that's it.

	
  * Nick and I will keep making stuff after TLW is over, but we're not replacing one crazy big workload for another crazy big workload. Whatever we work on next (be it G.R.I.E.F. or one of our other ideas), it won't be as regular or as big as The Leet World.


Anything not answered there is something we don't know the answers to or can't really address at this point. There's a lot that we still don't know, but I thought I'd do my best to answer the things we could. 

Episode 8 will be out at some point this week. I'm excited to start this half of the season. It's seriously going to be wild.
