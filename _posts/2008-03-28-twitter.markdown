It's been nice to chill for a few days after the release of Episode Eleven. We're jumping into Episode Twelve over the weekend, so that should be fun. More updates on that and the rest of Season One in a couple of days.

You may have noticed on the right hand sidebar that there is a new [Twitter](http://www.twitter.com) feed. What's Twitter, you say.

Well, Twitter is kind of a mini-blog for short updates. We're going to be using it to talk day-to-day about episode updates, thoughts and general goofiness- basically anything that is neat but we don't need to make a blog post about. Just go [sign-up for Twitter](https://twitter.com/signup) and choose to follow the [Smooth Few Films](http://twitter.com/smoothfewfilms) page- it'll also let you know when we update the front page of our website, so you can, say, get a text message or an IM whenever an episode comes out.

Go do it!
