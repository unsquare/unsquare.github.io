The Leet World is a reality show set in Counter-Strike: Source that places CT's and T's against one another in order to determine who is the best!  Now that the first challenge has come and gone, each of the teams is getting to go on vacation to beautiful Italy!  Unfortunately, it turns out that each of the team leaders has plans of their own for their respective teams- how will the contestants respond to being denied their leisure time?
