![Hoth](http://smoothfewfilms.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/hoth.jpg)We now present to you Episode 23 of Web Zeroes, [Strike Force](http://smoothfewfilms.com/2010/06/09/strike-force/). This episode features the rapidly progressing story of Alex's job woes, along with the Techstrogen side of things, where Bobby King and the Hobo have figured out just how much power they have over the show. Naturally, they go batpoop insane about this, as they are wont to do.

There are just 2 more episodes to the season, and we are eager to be done with them. Both for the work involved, but also with some of the gags planned, particularly for the finale. Unfortunately, we've hit a snag in production, so we will be taking the next two weeks off to get those wrapped up and delivered back-to-back. I know it stinks, but we just couldn't stay on target the way we wanted to. Like Luke did.

Anyway, I'm a big fan of this newest episode. Having the scenes at Alex's work make for a nice break from the normal zaniness of the trio, and have added a nice new dynamic to the season I feel like. This episode and and the next were another pair written by the totally rad [Jeff James](http://www.twitter.com/unsquare), so give props to him. Also, Jace's work is stellar yet again. He always manages to surprise me, and hearing how his style has grown since The Leet World is pretty cool. 

Anyways, hit the jump to see the episode!<!-- more -->
