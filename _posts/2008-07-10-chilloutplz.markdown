Ok, editing my old post didn't work. You guys have to stop going crazy and refreshing the site. At this rate, even if the episode were done right now, we wouldn't even be able to upload it. Unfortunately for you, I can't just post the episode whenever I feel like. It's more than likely not going to be until late this afternoon or this evening (it's currently not even 10 AM).

I'm excited you guys want to see the finale, and we're excited to give it to you, in due time. For now, see [this video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZELGADNUks) for reference.

EDIT: Some of you thought I was very upset when I posted this. It wasn't that, it's just that I NEEDZ MAH SITE (insert angryface)!
