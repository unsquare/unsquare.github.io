We now present to you folks Episode 22 of Web Zeroes, [Day in the Life of Diane](http://smoothfewfilms.com/2010/06/02/day-in-the-life-of-diane/), an episode whose title makes it quite obvious what the actual content of the show is about. This episode is not to be confused with another short where [two machines talk to each other](http://smoothfewfilms.com/2008/01/18/portal-a-day-in-the-life-of-a-turret-2/), though that is amusing as well. 

Many thanks and kudos to my good-natured (and lovely) wife, who puts up with more than she ought to regarding our Web crazyness. This show constantly finds new ways to land close to home, and this episode really does kind of imitate what an average weekend is like for Jen. Minus actual hobos, though Miles does play the part a bit too well. This episode officially sets us up for the final arc of the season, and the next three episodes really build on one another until an epic and hopefully hilarious conclusion. I think you guys will like what's coming, but then again, I say that all the time. 

Over the next couple of weeks, you guys are going to start to see a few more updates around here, as I've been itching to get past my WZ writing so I can put in some good content for you. Look forward to that, which will include more lost TLW information, episode outtakes, and then some. In the meantime, hit the jump to see the episode!
