![tlw208](http://smoothfewfilms.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/05/tlw208.jpg)We don't really have deleted scenes in our episodes all that often, but once in a blue moon it happens. There are a few reasons for this. I'm a strong believer that in our show, scenes should do three things:



	
  * Advance the story

	
  * Build characters

	
  * Have lulz


While it's not possible to accomplish all three things in each and every scene, we hope to have at least two, and if nothing else, just one. When a scene has none of those 3 things, then it usually just gets axed, never to see the light of day. And trust me, that's for the better.

However, there are other times when we cut scenes simply because YouTube sucks, and only allows us to put up 10 minute videos with our account (certain accounts allow you to do more if you've signed up before a certain date, but we were late to the YouTube party). We could split the video in two for them and deliver you guys a longer one, but it becomes such a pain in the ass to do this. 

This is where you guys get screwed a little, and that's mostly due to many of the kind folks over at YouTube being unable to grasp the concept of checking our profile page for the second video. Seriously, I don't know how some of them even turn on their computers (if you're here from YouTube, you are not included in this group, since you are clearly of a superior intelligence). Luckily, this has only affected just a couple of episodes throughout the entire series.

Anywho, Episode 8 of Season 2 had a couple of scenes cut for this very reason. One of them was filmed and one wasn't. Check them out after the jump.

This first scene takes place before Asher's confrontation with Westheimer in the restroom. We never got around to filming it, because it became apparent that the episode wouldn't need it, time-wise.




[scrippet]**EXT. Back Yard, Shed**

Asher is walking up to the shed. Cortez appears behind him.

CORTEZ
A donde vas?

ASHER
Ah, yes, Mr. Cardinal. I need to inspect this shed in order to locate Westheimer.

CORTEZ
This shed belongs to the Terrorists, now. And it is not a dog house... you will not find the old man within.

AHMAD
(From downstairs) Ohhhh snap!

ASHER
If he is not here, where could he be? I must speak with him so the Counter-Terrorists can begin training.

CORTEZ
Even if I knew where he had gone to lick his wounds, I would not tell you.

ASHER
I see. You do not trust me. Neither do the others.

CORTEZ
They know as well as I that something is not right in your cabesa. I do not need my eyes to see this.

ASHER
Yes, I have read your file. You speak of the time your brother Mendoza betrayed you and left you for dead.

CORTEZ
And you speak of things you know nothing of. Mention his name again, and you are a dead man.

ASHER
Mendoza... is a sore spot for you?

CORTEZ
Si. And you would do well to remember this.

AHSER
Yes... yes, I believe I will.[/scrippet]




The second scene happens after Player and Chet are found out by Westheimer and Asher, just before Player goes to see Dr. Soong. It was funny, but when we were trying to keep it under 10 minutes, became unnecessary, because it would make sense that Player would search for the doctor after Asher's cryptic comments, anyway. The episode ended up being 10 minutes exactly, so this scene had to go.

Hope you enjoyed. By the way, our next post should be the release of Episode 9.
