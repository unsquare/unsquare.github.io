So, here's the commentary for Episode 3 of The Leet World, which we were finally able to record when Daniel got back. Pardon some of the audio levels, there were a few mic issues, forcing us to record it the way we would a podcast, rather than what the last commentaries sounded like.

On the plus side, it is now attached to the video of Episode 3, so no worries on playing it yourself in time with the audio file. We might get around to the first two eps eventually, but there definitely wasn't time to do it over the weekend. This whole commentary thing has been trial and error for us, that's for sure. I think the Ep 4 commentary will be perfect.

So listen/watch, comment and enjoy. Don't worry if you don't see any video at first, it doesn't start til a few seconds in.
