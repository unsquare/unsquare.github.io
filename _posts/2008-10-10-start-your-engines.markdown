Season 2 production is fully underway. We got together and recorded audio for episodes 1-3 the other night, and it was definitely a time saver already to do them all at once. Since the hard part is getting everyone together and then getting started, it really took about the same amount of time as it does for one episode. The method is already working!

The reason I waited so long to update this week is because I was hoping to have something cool to share with you guys, but I'm going to have to wait just a little longer. Rest assured, a barrage of content is going to start coming out next week, ranging from Web Zeroes episodes to TLW teasers, screenshots and even the soundtrack very soon.

Also, I'm not sure how many of you are familiar with Ross Scott's work, but he has put together a brilliant machinima piece called "Oil's Well" that he produced in Half-Life 2. Give it a watch, and [visit his website](http://www.civil-protection.blogspot.com/).
