Well, we are still hard at work on Episode Eight.  And when I say hard, I mean it.  This week was the most rigorous week we've had as far as Smooth Few Films goes, so it's been pretty nuts.  While we're not keen on giving out release dates (any number of things can cause a delay when working on an episode), it should be here at some point next week.  We'll give you more when we have a better idea.

There won't be reason to stop showing up, though, because our Halo short will be up in the next day or two!  This is pretty exciting for us, and we think that you guys should enjoy it.  Now if you're wondering to yourself "What? Why have they been doing this Halo thing instead of TLW", it's because we are submitting it to a contest that ends this week.  In addition to that, this realistically delayed the release of Episode Eight by less than a day, because it was worked on at points when all 3 of us could not be together to film TLW stuff.  So no worries.

In the meantime, here's some notable gaming news from the last few days: [Companion Cubes are on Sale](http://store.valvesoftware.com/productshowcase/productshowcase_WCC-Plush.html), [Crysis Rocks Trip Vid Cards](http://www.gemaga.com/2007/12/12/over-1800-in-video-cards-to-run-crysis-on-very-high), [A Bajillion in the Warhammer Beta](http://www.joystiq.com/2007/12/13/more-than-half-a-million-sign-up-for-warhammer-online-beta/), [Big Damn NES Controllers/PC's are Awesome](http://www.nintendowiifanboy.com/2007/12/12/big-damn-nes-controller-is-really-a-big-damn-pc/), and [New Fixes and Maps are Coming to TF2](http://www.shacknews.com/onearticle.x/50336)!

Edit:  Companion cubes are already sold out!  Guess I'm not the only one who needs a fuzzy friend.
