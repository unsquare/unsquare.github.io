![daniel](http://smoothfewfilms.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/04/daniel.jpg)Today is a very special day for Daniel, director, and voice of Ellis and Adam Sizzler in The Leet World. He turns 28 years of age. Yikes. I hope he doesn't break a hip or something. Wish him a good one, he deserves it.

Production has started again on the show as of this weekend, and we are slicing that thing up like raptors in Jurassic Park. That is to say, the attack will come from the side, from the raptor you didn't even know was _there_. The second half of this season is kind of awesome, so we're looking forward to getting on with it. I'll have some screenshots for you dudes later on in the week, I hope.

I randomly watched a lot of Season 1 yesterday, for the first time in several months. While watching some battle sequences, it came upon me to ask you dudes which gunfight/battle you've liked best so far in The  Leet World. So, answer away. What's your favorite?
