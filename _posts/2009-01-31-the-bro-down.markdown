[![fight](http://smoothfewfilms.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/01/fight-246x300.jpg)](http://smoothfewfilms.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/01/fight.jpg)As promised, here is Season Two, Episode Four of The Leet World, [Fight Nubs](http://smoothfewfilms.com/2009/01/30/fight-nubs/), ready for your hungry watching eyes. In this episode, we see the ramifications of a certain cast member's actions, in more ways than one. It's definitely got some lol-worthy moments, so I hope you guys enjoy it.

Be sure to visit the [Season 2 premiere page](http://www.smoothfewfilms.com/premiere) to see a higher-res version of the episode. I'm a big fan of the page, and still love Nick to this day for making it. It helps Season 2 episodes feel more like an event, in my mind, which is exactly what we like.

Or if you just want to watch it the normal way, the video is waiting for you after the jump.

Just a fun side note: this season, we're rolling with a new structure in terms of how we develop the show. If you remember, a few months back we talked about producing the season in three-to-four episode chunks, or arcs. Episode 3 marked the end of the first set of episodes that we made, and Episode 4 marks the beginning of the second set. It's definitely helping us not only in the speed of making the episodes, but also in the writing of them. I think when it's all said and done, you'll be able to look at the arcs and see how they break down. Cool stuff.

Enjoy!
