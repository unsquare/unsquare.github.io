Sounds like something Montrose would say, no?  As is becoming a custom around here, we are now delivering to you all the teaser for Episode Five of The Leet World.  As you may have guessed, some traveling looks to be going on in this next episode, and we think you'll enjoy the results.  It'll be released next week!  There are a few audio glitches here and there, but don't worry, they'll be fixed by release.

Watch at your heart's content.
