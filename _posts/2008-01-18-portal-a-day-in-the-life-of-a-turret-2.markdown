If a turret bitches about its job and nobody is around to hear it, does it make a sound? You bet it does. "A Day in the Life of a Turret" catches two turrets on the job during a typical day at the Aperture Science Enrichment Center, and the monotony that lies within.

The background music is by [Damn Dangerous](http://www.myspace.com/damndangerous) and is called "[Nine to Five](http://www.smoothfewfilms.com/2008/01/21/nine-to-five/)".
