Since it's been a few days without any kind of tangible proof that Episode Four is actually coming, we thought we'd give you guys a trailer for it.  Hope you enjoy.  Should be out sometime next week.  Hopefully, there will also be more activity on our server in the coming days- my Steam decided to break so I haven't been able to play.  Soon, though.  Soon.
