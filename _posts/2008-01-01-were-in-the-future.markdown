We are now in 2008. Where are my flying cars and robots? Nowhere. The future is lies, I've decided.

In honor of this new year, I bring to you more gifts, tidings, etc. First, we've been hearing that some people want the lolcat picture from the holiday special...

Second, I have the audio outtakes from Episode Eight. Funny stuff. To me, one of the best parts is when I'm doing the voice of the combine soldier (pre-effects, of course), and I slip into doing Cortez. I kind of freaked out when I did it, because it was so sudden. Also, every time Nick goes off in the "Chet" persona, it's always hilarious. Give it a listen.

Happy New Year, dudes!
