PAX is officially over, and the weekend was worth every penny we spent getting there. It's always been my dream to attend something like this, a video game convention I suppose, and it certainly didn't disappoint. If you've been reading up on it over at [GamerSushi](http://www.gamersushi.com), you'll know that I've played a ton of games and seen a lot of cool things.

Daniel and I were definitely able to get out and talk to some dudes and gals about Smooth Few Films, so that was fun, too. Nick was there in spirit (he couldn't make the trip), and he did such a good job designing the discs and the cards, I was proud to hand them out. I was probably awkward a couple of times, but I'm proud of us for having some balls and doing something that's really difficult to do- put yourself out there. It's one of those things that I've never been able to do until TLW really when it comes to creativity.

A lot of people talk and talk about doing something but never actually pull their pants up and do the darn thing, and this weekend, for good or ill, we took a stab at it.

Some of the highlights of the weekend:



	
  * **RoosterTeeth's cartoon.** The dudes behind [Red Vs Blue](http://www.redvsblue.com) debuted a cartoon of the same series, a project that they are taking a big risk on. It was incredible, hilarious, and looked gorgeous to boot. Being in the audience at their panel when Burnie paused the video, and informed everyone that we weren't about to watch machinima, that was wild.

	
  * **Felicia Day and The Guild Screening.** If you're unfamiliar with Felicia Day, she was the female lead in the recent web series ["Dr. Horrible"](http://www.drhorrible.com) by Joss Whedon, and it's a sight to behold, it truly is. She also is the writer and producer of [The Guild](http://www.watchtheguild.com/), another online web show that really gave us some inspiration for Web Zeroes. Long story short, we waited in line to meet Felicia Day (who was signing The Guild DVDs) and handed her a DVD of ours, and she actually made us sign it in case we ever got famous. Later that night we attended a screening of The Guild, and it was the first time the gang had ever screened it live, so that was a cool moment.

	
  * **Geoff Keighley/ Hal Halpin panel.** I attended a panel with Geoff Keighley of SpikeTV and Hal Halpin, head of the ECA, and it was a very thought provoking and intelligent discussion regarding the growth of the video game industry, lobbying for gamers, etc. Totally rocked. Gave each of them DVDs as well.

	
  * **Dinner with RoosterTeeth. **Steak and beer with these dudes is a good time. It was especially fun after a long exhausting day at PAX. It's nice to talk shop with guys who have been there, done that, and to just hang out and get fat with food.


Other highlights included Adam Sessler himself telling me that promoting ourselves at conventions was totally the thing we should be doing, meeting [Jonathan Coulton](http://www.jonathancoulton.com/) and him remembering A Day in the Life of a Turret, hanging out with Travis from [Darkspire Films](http://www.darkspirefilms.com) and a dude asking us to sign his companion cube.

Here are a couple of pictures:
