Hi folks, just a quick note... We've been informed by our webhost that they will be moving server clusters tonight, November 30th, starting at 10:00PM PST (GMT - 8). They estimate this process will take about 8 hours, so for those of us living on Central time, it should be fairly painless. For folks in other countries... not so much.

Thanks, and, as always, please donate. Your dollars buy Leeroy more computer peripherals.
