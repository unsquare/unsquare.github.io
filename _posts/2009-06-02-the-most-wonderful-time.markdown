![e3](http://smoothfewfilms.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/e3.jpg)I think E3 week is probably one of the coolest times of the year. It's like Christmas, but for nerds. If you're unaware or have been living under Nick's beard, E3 is a massive video game expo that happens around June. There's nothing like hearing all the gaming news and announcements such as Left 4 Dead 2, Halo: Reach and then some. If you aren't aware of what you missed today, you should definitely [go catch up](http://gamersushi.com/2009/06/01/microsoft-e3-presser-highlights/).

In other news, the next post on this fair site will be the long-awaited Episode 10 of Season 2. The Leet World's got a few watershed episodes, and I believe this to be one of them. I can't wait for you guys to see it. Don't punch yourself waiting for it, though.

Daniel's out of town for the next few weeks or so, but Nick has been busy editing while I move forward on Episode 11 assets. In the meantime, here are some last-minute screenshots of Episode 10 to hold you over until the big release.
