As promised, here is the song from [Damn Dangerous](http://www.myspace.com/damndangerous) that was composed for ["A Day in the Life of a Turret"](http://www.smoothfewfilms.com/2008/01/18/portal-a-day-in-the-life-of-a-turret-2/). We don't talk about Jace and his music as much as we should, but seriously- he makes our videos what they are. This newest song, "[Nine to Five](http://www.smoothfewfilms.com/extras/Nine_to_Five.mp3)", is a perfect example of how music can take a piece to the next level. In the near future, there will be more ways to get your hands on the music that is featured on The Leet World.
