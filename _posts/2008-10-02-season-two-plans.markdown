Wanted to give you guys a couple of production updates, as well as some screenies from the new episode of Web Zeroes that we filmed over the weekend. For future information, 9:30 am-11:30pm shoots were first thought up by the devil. And carried out by his bee-eff-eff Daniel, our steely-resolved director.

The first two episodes of The Leet World, Season 2 are almost written. There are some things we learned from the Finale - namely, that filming 3 "episodes" at once goes a lot faster than the normal method.

The idea this season is to film in 3 episode chunks. It'll be an interesting experiment. So, by the time we release Episode One, we should be done filming the first three. What's even cooler for you guys is that in theory, you should be getting a new episode almost exactly every two weeks on the dot, and in the meantime, we're three episodes ahead, not killing ourselves. I'm a fan of the not killing ourselves part.

Of course, that's all in theory, which, like Nick's beard, is the subject of much speculation and myth. Men have died on those furry peaks. We'll see how it goes. Filming hopefully starts next weekend.

Here are those screenshots I promised thirty seven seconds ago:
