[![tlw203](http://smoothfewfilms.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/01/tlw203.jpg)](http://smoothfewfilms.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/01/tlw203.jpg)So Episode 3 is going to be here in the next few days. Sweet. And rad.

Thanks for all of you who have voted for us for stuff for the last few weeks. There's just one week left to nominate Web Zeroes for the [Streamys](http://www.streamys.org/nominate.shtml)! For a full list of names and such for nominations, [check out this link](http://smoothfewfilms.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=34&t=1274&start=0&st=0&sk=t&sd=a), so you know what all we're hoping to be nominated for. Once again, only do this if you really think Web Zeroes deserves it. No pressure! But we would super appreciate it.

And speaking of appreciation... Over the course of the last year and a half (wow) that we've been battling this raging behemoth of a Counter-Strike machinima known as The Leet World, different fans of ours have shown their devotion and gratitude by getting creative and making tributes. I've made a list of a few of our favorites. Check it out after the jump!

  * [Donat's totally awesome TLW pictures](http://smoothfewfilms.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=5&t=586). These things have cracked us up from day one, and I look forward to each update.

	
  * [The Leet World Summer Vacation](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSm8CT3Ivus). Some of our outtakes performed in GMod. Seriously, this cracks me up.

	
  * [Tank's Review of The Leet World](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpFxC8Tun1Q). It's always awesome when someone takes the time to recognize our hard work. We enjoyed this video.

	
  * [The Leet World Theme on guitar](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0syNV_sq_xY). Great rendition of The Leet World on electric guitar.


We love checking out stuff that you guys make, so if you've done something creative about The Leet World, feel free to send it on over.
