Check it out dudes. It's Wednesday, so that means that Episode 6 of Web Zeroes, [Digg Bait](http://smoothfewfilms.com/2009/11/11/digg-bait/) is here for your enjoyment. It was written by JJ, our kindly Web master, making it the 2nd episode he's penned this season. More to come from him!

In this episode, Ray moves in with Alex after losing his job, and tries to take charge of the group by making top 10 lists with Nate. This episode really continues the ball rolling forward, and starts to move us toward some of the storyline that the original episodes hinted at with Ray and his unemployment. I think you guys will like where this is going.

As always, if you want to download it, hit up [Revision 3](http://revision3.com/webzeroes/diggbait). For now, just hit the jump to see the episode.

This actually marks the last episode that we filmed before we had released the very first one back in October. Pretty crazy that we did all that before anybody had even seen it. Be sure to leave a comment and let us know what you think!

Also, come back later this week for an interesting breakdown of some of our inspiration for Leet World. And now, I'm off to play some Modern Warfare 2. Who's got it?
