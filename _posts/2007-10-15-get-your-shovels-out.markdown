Because we want you guys to get digg-ing.  For this next episode, we want to make a push to show The Leet World to as many people as possible, and the best and easiest way to do that is to get dugg!  If you're not sure what I'm talking about, digg.com is a place where people share the latest web news, trends, videos, etc, and it has a wide user base.

So, the episode will be out in the next few days (most likely Wednesday), and we are going to have a place for you to digg it- what we need you guys to do is head on over to [digg.com and click here to register](http://www.digg.com/register).  It's very easy and takes next to no time at all. If we can get a good amount of diggs on the first day, that will seriously show The Leet World to thousands of viewers.  And I know for a fact that there are enough of you that come to our site everyday to do it.  So basically, we're counting on you!  Head on over and register, and start digging once the episode is released!
