It's so bizarre to be working on our 12th episode. So far, Episode Twelve isn't quite the three-headed dogbeast we imagined it would be. I think we always forget how much easier a regular episode is in comparison to something like a challenge episode.

If you haven't seen the [Themetacular Contest](http://www.smoothfewfilms.com/about/contest/) rules yet, I'd advise you to check them out. Remember, we don't want to just hear you guys trying your best to imitate Damn Dangerous- get creative, go all out, make the song your own, change the style- the more distinct, the better.

Here are some screenshots from Episode Twelve to satiate The Leet World appetite, if only temporarily. Over the weekend, we're going to start adding some really cool new content to the website. A virtual nerdery for those of you obsessed with really digging into that kind of stuff. Should be fun.
