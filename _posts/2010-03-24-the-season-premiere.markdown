![Avatar](http://smoothfewfilms.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/avatar-movie.jpg)Here is Episode 14 of Web Zeroes, and the start of Season 2, [Going Viral](http://smoothfewfilms.com/2010/03/23/going-viral/). In it, we find out the fate of Ray and the guys, and what is next on the docket in their attempts to be Web famous. It might involve something you all are familiar with. Or not. Plus, there are Avatar jokes.

Whereas last season took a few episodes to launch us into the story proper, we're getting things going right off the bat this time around. And it only gets more ridiculous from there. Also, I'd like to point out that a couple of cast members appear shirtless and/or pantless in this kick-off, so yeah, it's a party. Take off your pants too, if you want. We're not here to judge. Well, maybe I am.

Special thanks to [RoosterTeeth](http://www.roosterteeth.com/) for appearing in our goofy show again. And much thanks to Jace and Alex for wrangling the music and sound over the weekend. They are wranglers of the finest sort, and they also work for free, so that's cool.
