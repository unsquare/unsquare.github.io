I thought I'd post to let you guys know that Jace (aka DamnDangerous) has put up a preview of 2 songs from the TLW Season One Soundtrack, due out in the next couple of weeks. I know we've been promising this thing for awhile, but getting everything in order is a lot more complicated than we thought, and the album got all the time it needed to be as excellent as possible.

The two songs are on [Jace's myspace page](http://www.myspace.com/damndangerous). One is titled "If It Bleeds", which is from Episode 8 during the hunt of the Domination Man, and the other is called "The End of all Things" which is from part 3 of the Season Finale. He has remixed and fleshed out both of these tracks from their original small bits from the episodes and turned them into fully realized songs.

Remember, this is just a preview, so you won't be able to download them until we start selling the album. Trust me when I say it'll be worth it.

Each of the songs that Jace chose for the soundtrack has gotten similar treatment (10 songs in all plus 3 additional versions of the theme), so you can trust me when I say it freaking rocks. Expect a full track listing and price details in a week or so.
