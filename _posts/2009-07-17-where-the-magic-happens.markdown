[![tlwsetup](http://smoothfewfilms.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/tlwsetup.jpg)](http://smoothfewfilms.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/tlwsetup.jpg)Nick and I have been hard at work on the series finale, parts 1 and 2 for the last couple of weeks. We're hoping to release them close together, but we haven't quite decided on how that will go down yet. We have a limited amount of time to finish all of this, and we're working our butts off to do so. You'll get the first screenshots this weekend or early next week.

I know that some of you long timers have seen some of our setup pictures before, but I thought it would be cool to talk about again. For those of you that don't know, TLW isn't made inside of a studio, but rather, in my spare bedroom, with a total of 6-7 computers, depending on what's working at the time. That's machinima for you.

Ideally, we'd show this in the making of video we've been wanting to do, but that's been put on hold indefinitely while we try to finish this darn show. Anywho, there's a general overview, with pictures, after the jump.

Four of the computers you see there are "actor" computers. They control the characters that make up each scene. The other two computers are the "camera" and "capture" computers. The camera computer is the player camera that captures the footage. You might also notice the piles of scripts everywhere. One of those is for Episode 13.

We almost never use spectator cam for the show, in case you were wondering. Rather, we use the following source commands: _sv_cheats 1_, _cl_drawhud 0_, and _cl_drawviewmodel 0_ to remove the HUD and the weapon model (we film through sniper rifles for adjusted fov values).

Anywho, you can see the camera computer above. It's connected to the capture computer, which is Daniel's Mac that has been essentially confiscated by Smooth Few Films. The camera computer runs out via DVI to component cables over to the AJA Kona card, so that we can capture in 720p. See all the crazy cables above, as well as the back of the capture card.

The "sound booth" we use is actually just a closet. Notice the ghetto tape holding the mic stand up, as its puny snake neck buckles under the weight of the mic and the popper stopper. Totally not glamorous in the slightest.

So there you have it. Hopefully that doesn't let the air out of your tires any. This show is mega ghetto. And we are ghetto fabulous.
