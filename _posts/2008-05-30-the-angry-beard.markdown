If you spot an angry beard, be careful. He is like the Cloverfield monster, wreaking general chaos and causing disorientating camera work. _And lo, his name be Nick._

Typically, audio outtakes encompass two full episodes, but Episode 13, being our longest and wordiest so far, had enough material all its own to provide you guys with some mega-lulz. Right-click to save, if you must.

Beware, those of you who are feint at heart. Some NSFW language at the end from our typically jovial bearded one. Keep voting on the [Themetacular Challenge](http://www.smoothfewfilms.com/2008/05/26/themetacular-voting-begins/)!
