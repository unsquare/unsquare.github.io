Hey dudes, just letting everybody know that there will finally be people playing in our server again, as I have recently gotten my CS:S up and running.  Not entirely sure what the problem was, but part of the way through Episode Four (I measure time by episodes now) my CS:S straight up kicked the bucket.  A re-install of Steam did not seem to do the trick, so I actually reformatted my hard drive and went with a fresh install of XP, and now all is well.  Look for us to be on every now and then (probably even tonight) at 63.209.36.184:27015.  Should be fun.
