The good dudes over at RoosterTeeth posted a new special "Red vs Blue" video for the Machinima Europe festival.  It really is kind of hilarious.  [Click here](http://rvb.roosterteeth.com/home.php) to go check it out.  I'd like to meet these guys some day.  I mean, we're all Texans, so why not?

Also, I miss Nick and Daniel.Â  But not really.
