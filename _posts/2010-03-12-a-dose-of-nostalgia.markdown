While we had some good times working on TLW, we have all moved past it, and are happy with what we produced. Since it's so far in our rear view mirrors at this point, there is nothing that really makes us miss The Leet World. Except maybe this.



The trailer was cut by [Daniel Sheehan](http://www.youtube.com/user/nelandquinten), who we've linked to before for another [sweet trailer](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRqUvEg9MAo) he made during Season 2. Apparently, he used four clips from every. single. episode. Pretty impressive. Give the dude some love.
