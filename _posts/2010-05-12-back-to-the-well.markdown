![Counter Strike: Source](http://smoothfewfilms.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/css.jpg)As I said last week, we're going to be off from releasing new episodes of Web Zeroes until next Wednesday, May 19th. We're still hard at work on the show, though, so it's not a total break for us. There might also be some Halo Reach going on in the meantime, but really, can you blame us? I'm a Halo fanboy, what can I say?

In addition to the Halo Reach beta madness, I was wondering if you guys had seen the news about Counter-Strike: Source [getting a new beta](http://kotaku.com/5536413/counter+strike-source-gets-extensive-update-new-beta), a big update and some achievements? Pretty interesting timing for that. It makes me wonder if they're getting ready to return to that old CS well for more multiplayer goodness. To be honest, if they ever did that, I would play the junk out of that game. The Counter-Strike series still remains the best multiplayer gaming experience I've had, so I'd be excited for a new one. Then again, this is all speculation on my part.

Confession: I spent an hour today going over the [TLW TV Tropes page](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheLeetWorld). If you've never seen it, it's a very insightful breakdown of some of the major tropes, themes and characters of that show. I almost went back and watched a few episodes because of it. Almost.

Speaking of Leet World, sometimes I do the voices on set of Web Zeroes. Sometimes, the camera catches me doing this. See the example below...



These little behind the scenes snippets may start coming more regularly. Kthx.
