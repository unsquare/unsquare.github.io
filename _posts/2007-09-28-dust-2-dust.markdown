It's challenge week on The Leet World!  This is the first of three challenges to determine once and for all who's better: CT's or T's.  Have the teams worked together long enough to be effective?  Which of the noobs will hurt his team more?  Will Leeroy get his revenge on Cortez?  And which team will stand victorious?
