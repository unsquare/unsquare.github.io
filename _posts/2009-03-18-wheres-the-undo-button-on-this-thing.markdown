![facepalm](http://smoothfewfilms.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/facepalm2ly3.jpg)<del>Hi folks. Just a quick post to let you know that we've had a loss of data and the downloads are not currently available. The culprit here was a tinkering webmaster (me) and and a crappy Wordpress plugin that decided to delete a folder without telling me what it was doing. It's possible our hosting company can restore the domain from a backup, but I'm not going to count on it.</del>

<del>We have backups of almost everything, and I'm going to begin the process of getting those re-uploaded onto the site as soon as I can, but the main thing that we don't have consistent backups of are the HD versions of season 1.</del>

<del>If you or anyone else you know has all of season 1 in the HD format, I'd appreciate it if you could upload them somewhere like [FileFront](http://filefront.com) and email me a link to the file(s) at [jeff@smoothfewfilms.com](mailto:jeff@smoothfewfilms.com). No need to post the links in the comments, but if you want to "claim" which episodes you are uploading, that might help prevent folks from doubling up on the same episodes. Thanks!</del>

UPDATE: Lucky for us, it looks like I actually jumped the gun here. When I started downloading a backup of the remaining folders on the site, it was a much bigger download than I was expecting. I dug around a bit and it turns out that the stupid plugin had just moved the missing folder about three deep inside a few other folders. Needless to say, I'm both relieved and in the process of making a giant backup of the entire site. You can return to previously scheduled programming now.
