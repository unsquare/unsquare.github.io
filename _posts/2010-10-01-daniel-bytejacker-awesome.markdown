I was looking through the site the other day, and I can't believe I forgot to post this back when it happened. One of the bonuses to being on Revision3 for a couple of seasons was the opportunity to meet some awesome folks in the same boat as us. This afforded us double rainbow like powers to create epic crossovers. 

You already saw [Daniel make an appearance on the Revision3 show Film Riot](http://smoothfewfilms.com/2010/05/05/a-late-spring-break/), where he demonstrated some of the audio techniques we used on Web Zeroes. But did you know that he also appeared on their indie video game show [Bytejacker](http://www.bytejacker.com/)? Nerd and host Anthony Carboni did an episode where he toured the offices of Revision3, speaking with people from the other shows. One of those people included Daniel, who appeared as his character Ray from Web Zeroes. The results were hilarity and plaid. Daniel shows up at 3:57.



In other video game related news, today we posted an article over at GamerSushi about the top 30 [upcoming games of 2010](http://gamersushi.com/2010/10/01/welcome-to-fall-the-upcoming-games-of-2010/), and I love it. Go check it out. Got any you're looking forward to?

More free soundtrack titles coming next week, plus hopefully some video/pics from Fantastic Fest.
