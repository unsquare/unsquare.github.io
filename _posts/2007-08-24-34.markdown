If you're here for Episode Two, scroll down, or go to the [episodes](http://www.smoothfewfilms.com/episodes/) page.  So far, we've been hearing great things about this one- as I said before, we're overall much happier with how it came out compared to Episode One.  We've already started on the next installment, which should be a tad easier to film.  The second episode just hit [machinima.com](http://www.machinima.com/film/view&id=23297), [spikedhumor.com](http://www.spikedhumor.com/articles/122505/The_Leet_World_Episode_2_Dirty_Deeds.html), and [youtube](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UfXT4TW6yq8), so be sure to vote for us if you feel like it.  And keep spreading the word about the show.

Nick put this nifty little poster together for "Dirty Deeds", so I thought I'd post it here, even though I already stuck it up on the forums...  Click on the thumbnail for a larger version.

Stay tuned to our site, because early next week we should be putting out a small preview of Episode Three.  More than just a screenshot this time.




Going to be playing some Bioshock this weekend.  Very excited.  Episode Two's release kept me from opening it- but nothing will stand in my way this time!
