Soon, thousands of refresh buttons will cry out in terror...

That's because Episode Twelve hits tonight (Monday) or tomorrow morning (Tuesday). Nick and Daniel put in a monster day yesterday to plow through most of the episode, and we're on the home stretch. We'll do whatever we can to make sure that you dudes are watching it tonight, but the empire knows we're coming, and we are just a small rebel squadron.

Give Han more time â€” he won't let you down.
