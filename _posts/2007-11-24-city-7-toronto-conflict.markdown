This is perhaps some of the coolest game news I've seen in some time.  City 7: Toronto Conflict is a HL2 mission created by a student development team.  Basically, they have recreated the city of Toronto to capture what was a horrific combine occupation not just in City 17, but the entire world.  Browse the site, check out the screenshots, and learn more about the mission: it's cool stuff!
