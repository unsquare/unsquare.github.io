Just wanted to give you guys a head's up about [One Shared Vision](http://www.onesharedvision.com/), a totally sweet machinima project put together by several machinimakers in the community, with the goal of letting people know about [Child's Play](http://www.childsplaycharity.org/), a charity that donates games to children in hospitals. 

Each week, a new machinima will be out, promoting Child's Play and also providing some bueno holiday entertainment and/or _lulz_. That's a proper film making term, be tee dub. 

Smooth Few Films is a part of this project, and you will see a short from us later this month. It might star some of your favorite TLW dudes.

For now, enjoy the launch of [One Shared Vision](http://www.onesharedvision.com/) by watching this video from machinima dude supreme [Phil Rice](http://z-studios.com/blog/), and be sure to find out more about [Child's Play](http://www.childsplaycharity.org/) to help! It's an excellent charity that raises millions of dollars worth of games for sick kids in hospitals.





Seriously, the ending slays me every time.
