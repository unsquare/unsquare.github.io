There's a reason that there are so many failed or left behind machinima series out there- machinima is a pain in the arse to make.

Throughout the course of Episode 11, there have been all kinds of... "complications". Relatives coming in town to visit (which consequently disrupts the filming schedule), a broken "actor" computer that had to be replaced, working full-time, the Rockets 22 game winning streak, etc. Oh, and our jobs. The list goes on. When you add that this might be the most complicated episode we've attempted, then you've got a lot on the Smooth Few Films plate.

But it has finally arrived. Almost. Tonight (Tuesday the 25th) or tomorrow morning (Wednesday the 26th), Episode 11 will be here.

Before this, the longest two episodes to make were Episodes 4 and 8. That's elite company. Make of that what you will. I'm not making any promises, but this episode has epic face-rocking potential laden within its bytes of data. And like the wily creatures from the Alien films, it is ready to pounce and plant its awesomeness in your body.
