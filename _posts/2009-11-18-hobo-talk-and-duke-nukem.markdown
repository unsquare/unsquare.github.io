![dnf](http://smoothfewfilms.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/dnf.jpg)Alright, gents and ladies. Here's Episode 7 of Web Zeroes, [Marathon Men](http://smoothfewfilms.com/2009/11/18/marathon-men/). In it, the dudes try to do a video game marathon for charity, and Ray meets a hobo with quite a story. Also, there is World of Warcraft. 

We really like this episode, and hope you guys do, too. It takes place in me and my wife's new home (our first!), so there's a change of setting from the rest of the series. In addition, you should check out the [Child's Play](http://www.childsplaycharity.org/) charity, because they do awesome things for kids in hospitals by providing them video games. For real, look them up. 

Much thanks to our friend Miles for his excellent performance in this episode, as well as Jace for once again making things rule with his music. Hit the jump to see the episode!

Also, I feel like I have to ask this, because I know how many of you are source fans- who bought Left 4 Dead 2?
