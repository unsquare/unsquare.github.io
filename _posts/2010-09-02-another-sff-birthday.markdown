[![Portal Cake](http://smoothfewfilms.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/birthday-portal.jpg)](http://smoothfewfilms.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/birthday-portal.jpg)Well, last month we officially passed the three year birthday of Smooth Few Films. That's right, in August of 2007 we first started posting Leet World episodes, and the rest is kind of history, I suppose. A good or bad history? Who knows. In fact, thanks to Matt and the trusty Web Archives, we actually have [a snapshot of the old Web site](http://web.archive.org/web/20070826232938/http://www.theleetworld.com/), in that first week of posting.

It's funny thinking back to those first few weeks. We've told the story several times in a variety of different ways, but we honestly thought we would only make a few episodes and then stop the whole thing. It was unplanned, partially spontaneous, and then the support for what we were doing was ludicrously overwhelming, which helped us through some of the more brutal production runs. Interesting fact: we came _this_ (imagine me holding my finger and thumb really close together) close to quitting during the production of Episode 11 of Season 1. Two series and a few years later bring a bit of perspective, and it's been a mostly nice ride, though it's had its own share of bumps. Which is why the current break is rocking our faces. 

Anyway, I'm curious: of the people left that are still faithfully checking this site (thanks so much, by the way), how many of you were here since the very beginning? If not, when did you first stumble across our humble abode on the Intertubez? Answer away, commenters and lurkers.

P.S. Stay tuned for more free tracks of the TLW Season 1 soundtrack.
