We appreciate all of the comments on the Season 2 teaser/Halloween message/release announcement thing we put out. Glad you guys are enjoying the ride leading up to the second season. Trust me, we are too. We've had some bumps, but now everything is running smoothly. Much thanks to Lord Ned for the assistance with some of my Hammer frustrations.

And while I'm thinking about it, I have some screenshots from Episode 1 of Season 2. Enjoy!

I know that some of you are having problems logging in. That comes from some pretty hardcore caching we've got set up on the site- all you need to do is just refresh the page (try it more than once if you need to) and it should help.

There's a cool new post up on GamerSushi, titled ["5 Features That More Shooters Need"](http://gamersushi.com/2008/11/05/5-features-more-shooters-need/). Thought you guys would like it since I mention some Counter-Strike in there.

Also, the dudes over at [The Duo Group](http://www.theduogroup.com/blog/?p=629) have just put out a new Gears of War machinima, as well as the guys over at [LitFuseFilms](http://litfusefilms.com/movies/flyingfenix/). It seemed appropriate to mention these in honor of the hallowed Gears of War 2, which I will be beating like it stole something later this week.
