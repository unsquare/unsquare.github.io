![film](http://smoothfewfilms.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/film.jpg)This weekend marked the second time that Smooth Few Films has been together in the 2 years since The Leet World started, and we had ourselves a good time. A hard, busy, _working-like-burros_ time, but a good time nonetheless. _Mr. Dangerous_, Jace Ford himself, flew down from California to bring his expertise and his music to the new project and the finale. Our webmaster and co-writer JJ also drove in from Austin. 

We used the holiday weekend to beat the new project like it stole something from us (ex: our lives), putting in four consecutive twelve hour work days. We also talked Final Fantasy 7, video game music, argued about making a cooler of beer look awesome, and ate lots of queso.

Signing deals means deadlines, and we are rushing like crazy to meet them. In all honesty, we probably shouldn't be working on the TLW Finale at all to make sure that we hit these mystical lines of death, but we are doing so whenever we can spare an instant, just for you guys, since we think you're cool. We've barely been able to make much progress on it in the last two weeks. That being said, the Finale should be out some time next week. Or at least, that's what we're gunning for. Feel free to woot.

If you're curious about what our weekend looked like, hit the jump to see some pictarz of our SFF Reunion. Jace is the wild one that looks like an animal.

Here you'll see some shots of us doing some set-ups in my apartment. The first shot is me, Chuck (our camera dude and DM) Daniel and Nick. The second is Daniel and I going over a script. And the third is Nick and JJ.

In this next group of shots, you'll see Jace manning the camera as well as Nick, Jeff and Daniel striking some fun poses. I love the second picture because Jace literally just walked into it in the middle of it.

Next up we've got some more shots of rehearsals at Nick's place followed by the dudes reviewing some dailies after the scene is done.

And finally, a Dungeons and Dragons scene, Jace getting ready to shoot a scene while Daniel looks very director-ly, and finally, our awesome crew dudes Chuck and Alex. Alex is the cool dude that handles our sound.

And there you have it. The SFF Reunion. Hope you enjoyed that brief glimpse on the inside.
