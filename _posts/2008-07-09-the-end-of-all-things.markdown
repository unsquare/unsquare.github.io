To borrow from Frodo (Smooth Few Films), we're glad that you will be with us, Samwise Gamgee (you dudes), here at the end of all things (the release of part 3 of the Season Finale), or rather, the end of Season One of The Leet World.

That should be tomorrow, by the way. I can't promise a particular time, it could be morning, it could be later on. But it won't be today, so lay off the F5 juice.

The final running time is somewhere around 18 minutes, and it's an action packed mofo on top of all of that. We will spend most of the evening and into the morning hours toiling away, and then Nick leaves me to fly to California for a (much-needed) vacation.

Happy waiting. If you haven't yet, check out our [Announcements](http://www.smoothfewfilms.com/2008/07/07/announcing-new-things/) about what's going to be coming after the season is over. Cool stuff.

EDIT: Good lord, dudes, chill. Yesterday I said it would be out at "some point" TODAY. It could be out tonight for all we know. Don't expect it until much later in the day (it's early morning right now). And if you don't what time of day that is for you, google it.
