We now present Episode 2 of Season 2 of The Leet World, ["The Shady Bunch"](http://smoothfewfilms.com/2008/12/16/the-shady-bunch/). I think you guys will find this one pretty funny, and I'm pretty sure you'll get a kick out of where things are going. Needless to say, things aren't quite the same around the house.

Over the next few weeks, we'll be releasing some more content for you guys, specifically a holiday-themed short with some of your favorite Counter-Strike machinima dudes, as well as some other extras that I think you'll want to stick around for, including outtakes for the first couple of episodes. Also, maybe some more pictures of Nick's beard.

You may need to pause the episode and let it load for a minute, due to the traffic. Also, remember to refresh after you log in so you can leave a comment. Video after the jump!

Enjoy!
