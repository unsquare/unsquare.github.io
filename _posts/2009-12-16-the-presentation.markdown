![iphone](http://smoothfewfilms.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/iphone.jpg)And now, here is Episode 11 of Web Zeroes, [Software of the Future](http://smoothfewfilms.com/2009/12/16/software-of-the-future/). In this ep, the guys pool their resources together to come up with an iPhone app presentation. Naturally, goofiness abounds. 

We are only days away from wrapping filming on the first season, and it's definitely a great feeling. There are going to be 13 episodes total, and the next two are kind of awesome. It's been great reading everyone's reactions to the series thus far, and I can't wait to see how you guys respond as the first season wraps up. 

In other news, the [Streamys](http://www.streamys.org/submit/public-submissions/) have started back up again, so your votes for Web Zeroes would definitely be appreciated. In particular, I'd love to see Jace Ford get the credit he deserves for consistently delivering us awesome music. Not that I'm telling you how to vote or anything...

Anyway, hit the jump to see the episode!

Much thanks to all of our friends that appeared in this episode. They say it takes a village to raise a child, and I suppose this is something pretty similar. We certainly wouldn't be able to get through all of this without their willingness to be in our goofy show.

As always, hit up [Revision3](http://www.revision3.com/webzeroes/softwareofthefuture/) to get a downloadable version of this episode, and spread the word about the show and the [Streamys](http://www.streamys.org/submit/public-submissions/) to your friends. Thanks for watching and enjoy!
