So today we knocked a big chunk of filming for Episode Thirteen out of the park, claiming it as our property in celebration not unlike a [young boy named Stephen](http://www.smoothfewfilms.com/2008/02/18/the-bag-boy/) once did. Yes, there was some collective Smooth Few Films squatting. Maybe one of the least problems-free days in our short history of production.

Nick upgraded the "camera" computer that we use to film the show, complete with an 8800 GT. Needless to say, our characters are colorful and smooth and it definitely enhances the look of everything. I even brought some screenshots to prove it.

Pretty nice, eh? In case you guys haven't been around, a lot went down the last two weeks. I've put together a list of some important posts to make it easier to navigate.
