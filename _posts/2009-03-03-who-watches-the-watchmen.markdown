[![watchmen](http://smoothfewfilms.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/watchmen.jpg)](http://smoothfewfilms.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/watchmen.jpg)I started reading The Watchmen this week in preparation for the movie's release, and also because I've been putting it off forever. I understand that it is a notch in the contemporary geek's bedpost to say he's read Watchmen, but I really have just never gotten around to it.

I'm trying not to get my hopes up about the movie too much. For one, I'm not sure how they are going to pull off the story, which in the graphic novel meanders on a slowly unraveling thread all around a generational mystery. Beyond that, there's no way they could possibly cram everything into even a 161 minute outing.

And while the [Watchmen trailers](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2VLA0tg5yI0) are actually shirt rippingly awesome, I do worry that it's one of those trailers that will end up being better than the movie. Because yes, sometimes this happens. And I have quite a few examples where this has happened in recent years, Sin City being the most notable of the bunch, whose trailer pulled off something much more interesting than the end product:



Hit the other examples after the jump.

  * [X-Men 3](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrhP6yuzUtQ)- even though the movie is a jumbled mess with too many things going on, this trailer really makes it look like one awesome epic fest.

	
  * [Garden State](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=la53nY41c9M)- to quote JJ, our webmaster, "a beautiful little piece of art".

	
  * [Superman Returns](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxzzVuVUYH4)- totally captures the essence of what is so fascinating about Superman.

	
  * [Star Wars Episode One: The Phantom Menace](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6hOlI9cg4o)- the ultimate geek-out trailer. People freaked when this thing released.


While I like a few of the movies on the list (and even Sin City), I just felt the trailers did a better job at doing what their counterparts tried to do. The Superman Returns trailer still gives me chills, even though the movie itself is kind of boring and a bit anti-climactic.

Anywho, I'm hoping The Watchmen doesn't join the ranks of these cinematic brethren. The hard thing about trying to nail down something that so many people love is that the slightest of changes can turn a crowd against you. However, even if the movie is awful, it won't change the fact that the original is a powerful, groundbreaking tale. 

So- who's planning on seeing it this weekend?
