![Chicken](http://smoothfewfilms.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/02/chicken1.jpg)Here is Episode 5 of Season 2 of The Leet World, [Return to Sender](http://smoothfewfilms.com/2009/02/18/return-to-sender/). In this episode, a surprise awaits the contestants as the Producer continues to influence the course of the season. And we finally get a glimpse of what the Terrorists have been hiding...

Remember, check out the [TLW premiere page](http://www.smoothfewfilms.com/premiere/) for a higher-res version of the episode. If it's not showing the new ep, just refresh or clear your browser cache. See the episode after the jump!

By the end of the episode I'm sure you'll notice that we are introducing a new element of Counter-Strike: Source to the show. We've wanted to do this for quite some time, so it's nice to finally slide it into the story. I think you'll be pleased with where it goes. 

Special thanks to Jace (AKA Damn Dangerous) for some especially rocking music. In the next couple of weeks, we're going to have a new TLW short, and the next two episodes after that will wrap up the first half of this season. Awesome? Yup.

Enjoy!
