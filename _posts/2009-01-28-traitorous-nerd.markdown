[![portal-turret](http://smoothfewfilms.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/01/portal-turret.jpg)](http://smoothfewfilms.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/01/portal-turret.jpg)Is it really almost February? About a year ago at this time, we released the [Portal video](http://smoothfewfilms.com/2008/01/18/portal-a-day-in-the-life-of-a-turret-2/) and got our site shut down by a flurry of visitors, who picked our site clean and left its carcass to dry. And then we moved on to Episode 9 of the first season.

The next episode of Season Two is going to hit in just a few days, so be ready for it. We're kind of kicking ass production-wise right now. In fact, we're already doing some pre-production on Episode Six.

Basically, we are [slapping episodes with our pimp hands](http://www.destructoid.com/elephant/ul/119409-LOLCAT.jpg) and then riding the wave. Ok, that last stuff isn't true. Anywho, here's a poll to ponder in the meantime. Log-in first, and then vote:
