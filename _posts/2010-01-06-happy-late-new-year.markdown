Figured I should take a few moments and wish all you dudes around the world a happy new year. It's more than a tad strange to be in 2010. This is the decade when we need to start seeing real live robots, flying cars and video phones I'm thinking. Either that or Half-Life 2 Episode 3. Just saying.

In the Smooth Few Films neck-of-the-woods, things have been awesome. We're taking a few weeks off of production since we've been working like crazy people since early 2009. So far, it's been cool to see the great reviews pouring in from the finale. We were more than a little excited to reveal that Rooster Teeth played a guest part in the final episode of Season 1 of Web Zeroes, so I hope you all enjoyed that present as much as we enjoyed providing it. 

We've already had a planning meeting for Season 2, and I honestly can't wait to start writing it. We'll be filming towards the end of January and will start building a foundation of _lulz_ upon which the new season will stand. 

In other news, one of my favorite machinima teams, TheDuoGroup, released a pretty cool Assassin's Creed original animation that they created called Initiation. I highly recommend watching it if you're finding yourselves parched for cool video game content since the end of The Leet World.



More content coming soon. Some of it Leet World related, some of it Web Zeroes related. Also, stay tuned for some posts that will be going up over the next few weeks informing you how you can help us out. You guys are awesome fans and we know you jump at the chance to support us. That being said, we want to go grassroots style on the promotion for Season 2 of Web Zeroes. We'll let you know more when we know more.
