We are still working on getting better versions up of Episode Six.  It's odd that some people seem to be having problems with the downloadable versions, while it's completely fine for others.  There's a highly technical term for this phenomenon: gremlins.

Work has begun on the filming of Episode Seven, so I thought I'd post just a couple of screenshots for you guys.  I think you'll find one rather interesting...
