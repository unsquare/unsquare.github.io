That's not a Speed Racer reference, but maybe it should be. I don't even know what that phrase means, but Daniel loves it. He's a catastrophe in man-shape. It seemed apt though, since tomorrow we're ditching Houston for a brief road trip up to Austin for the weekend.

Before that, though, we'll be releasing Episode 13. It should be here tonight or tomorrow morning, eagerly awaiting your viewing.

Since I know some of you will act like velociraptors systematically testing your browser's refresh buttons, remember that we have jobs. So if you're reading this at 5 pm central, wondering where the episode is... we're still at work. Doing _works_.
