He is muy triste. That means sad. He could tell you a story with his tears.

Somehow over the course of recording the dialogue for the [Season Finale](http://www.smoothfewfilms.com/2008/06/17/death-comes-home/) (we recorded parts 1 and 2 together, then part 3 a couple of weeks later), the mysterious burro became the brunt of many jokes. Were he real, I assure you his tears would fall like so much chubby rain. Or worse yet, _sideways rain._

Anywho, as I said in the last update, there were well over 50 audio tracks to sort out, so the outtakes are about twice as long as usual. Hopefully you have as much fun listening to them as we did being goofballs. Right click and select "save as" to download it.

Warning: Definitely some NSFW tomfoolery on here.

Enjoy. The first commentaries should be hitting the site next week.
