Exciting news! Hold on to your butts.

Here's what I can tell you: we just got a big deal to produce Smooth Few Films content. No, it is not TLW. I can't tell you who we made the deal with or go into more details about it, but trust me when I say it was a pretty crazy moment for us when we found out they were interested.

This means the "band is staying together" essentially, and that all of us (including Daniel) are rearranging some plans so that we can invest ourselves into this project. As a bonus for you guys, it means lots more Smooth Few Films content after The Leet World is over, which wasn't going to be the case before.

This is a huge opportunity that deserves all of our time. It's the kind of thing that we've been working towards for the last two years. We're kind of giving it all we've got. So it means there are probably going to be some more changes coming soon, and it is partially responsible for the extended time that Episode 14 is taking us.

We'll give some more information when we can, but our hands are a little tied. Rest assured, you should stick around for all of this because it's going to be badass.
