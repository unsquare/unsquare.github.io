You all know what this is, so I'll be brief. After many days of toil, we present to you Episode Eleven of The Leet World, "[Wrong Side of the Hax](http://www.smoothfewfilms.com/2008/03/25/wrong-side-of-the-hax/)".

It's the epic second challenge, so you all know what to expect. Shooting. Legendary music from [Damn Dangerous](http://www.myspace.com/damndangerous). Explosions. Drama. And maybe a twist or two.

Be friendly- [click here to Digg it](http://digg.com/pc_games/The_Leet_World_Ep_11_Wrong_Side_of_the_Hax). Only some of the downloadable versions are available at the moment, but the rest will be up later today.
