[![snow](http://smoothfewfilms.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/02/snow.jpg)](http://smoothfewfilms.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/02/snow.jpg)Thanks for all the great responses to Episode 4, dudes. Season 2 can be likened to a tiny snowball thrown down a hill, that just gets bigger and bigger until it demolishes some humble village down below. Only instead of snow, this ball is made of _awesome_. And instead of some humble village, it's you people.

Over the next few weeks, we're going to be filming some of what we do so that we can put together a nice little "making of The Leet World" feature. I'm really hoping we can show some of our process and have it be a mini-tutorial on Source machinima as well. Either that, or it'll just be us acting like morons. I'm cool with either.

Speaking of the future, here are some screenshots lifted directly from some place later in our own frenzied timeline. Well, not really, but they are from Episode Five, so that's kind of the future, right?
