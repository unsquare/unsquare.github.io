Smooth Few Films is now full speed ahead on the Season Finale. We feel like ship captains navigating our vessel through perilous waters. With sharks, pirates, ninjas and whatever else lurks in the depths of that dreadful ocean of releasing content.




I’m currently busy with putting the finishing touches on the script for part three of the finale, while Daniel cuts the trailer and Nick is both getting part one ready for Jace’s skillful composing and starting the rough edit of part two.




Trailer’s coming terribly soon. More screenies below.




Drink up, me 'earties, yo ho.
