So there's been tons of traffic coming through here today for the Portal video, ["A Day in the Life of a Turret"](http://www.smoothfewfilms.com/2008/01/18/portal-a-day-in-the-life-of-a-turret-2/), which you can find below.  As a result, things are a little sluggish around here, but it should all be cleared up over the course of the next day or so.

Also, I'd like to take this time to push people to [Jonathan Coulton's website](http://www.jonathancoulton.com), because hey, he wrote "Still Alive", and he's a plain awesome dude.
