![thanksgiving](http://smoothfewfilms.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/thanksgiving.jpg)Well, it's Wednesday, and even though it's Thanksgiving week for us, we still brought you some good old Web Zeroes content in the form of Episode 8, [Happy Pottermas](http://smoothfewfilms.com/2009/11/25/happy-pottermas/). I say old because many of you dudes have already seen it as part of the original run of Web Zeroes from the ancient days of 2008. 

Because of the way Revision3's release system works, however, we had to refer to this short as Episode 8, but it's not a true episode in that sense. Either way, I hope you guys find some good humor in it, even though you've seen it. If nothing else, you can marvel at Nick's short mane.

For now, hit the jump to see the video!

Feel free to comment when you're done. We wish you dudes a happy turkey day, and be safe over the holiday weekend!
