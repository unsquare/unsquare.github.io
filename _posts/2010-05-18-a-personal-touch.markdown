Just giving a quick update that Web Zeroes does in fact resume tomorrow, May 19th. The episode is titled "The Negotiator", and picks the story up pretty quickly. Looking forward to you guys seeing it as we wrap up the second half of the season.

I wanted to do a little personal promoting here. Firstly, I have a new website over at [EddyRivas.com](http://eddyrivas.com/). It's a personal blog, with bits more of my ramblings and some of my own writing, including a [brief rundown of my novel](http://eddyrivas.com/2010/05/14/seven-sons/).  Nick built it, so if any of you are looking to hire a man to a build a Web site, the bearded one is the one to do it. 

In addition, Daniel made a video for the company I work for. He is good at the videos. You should give it a watch, because it stars me. Also, it is about high-speed Internet.
