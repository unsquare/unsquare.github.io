A young soldier struggles to find meaning in a world that is driven by Achievements.  This is a short created in the Halo 3 engine, captured at 720p.  Anyone that's had any experience in the world of XBox Live should understand the plight of the characters involved.  We hope you all enjoy it.  We're thinking that this could turn into a regular series of shorts created in Halo.
