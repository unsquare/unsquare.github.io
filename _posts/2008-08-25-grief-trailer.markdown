[flv:http://video.smoothfewfilms.com/grief100.flv http://smoothfewfilms.com/images/full/griefthumb.jpg 480 270]

In a world overrun with hoodlums, criminals and vagabonds—_ griefers _— one government agency rises to take a stand against an abomination that threatens the very existence of Matchmaking.

This is a trailer for our new Halo mini-series that should be hitting next month, titled, as you all know, G.R.I.E.F. It's going to be an action/comedy series with a heavy emphasis on the action. We're excited about it, and you should be too.

Stay tuned to the site for some more cool announcements and extras this week (some of it TLW related) that you definitely don't want to miss. Huzzah!

Edit: Much thanks to Burnie from Rooster Teeth for the [shout out](http://www.roosterteeth.com/blog/viewEntry.php?id=2156719). You all should go check out [Ep 12 of Reconstruction](http://rvb.roosterteeth.com/archive/episode.php?id=323).
