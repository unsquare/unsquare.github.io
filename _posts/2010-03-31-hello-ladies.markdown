![Beatles Fans](http://smoothfewfilms.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/beatles-fans.jpg)We now present to you fine lads and lasses Web Zeroes Episode 15. Its official title, as we shared earlier this week, is [The Red Headed Menace](http://smoothfewfilms.com/2010/03/31/the-red-headed-menace/), or as our good Spaniard friends like Cortez would say, _"La Amenaza Pelirroja"_. Who is the particular menace in question? You'll have to watch to find out. I'll give you a hint, it's not a lame Star Wars prequel.

In this episode, we see the guys tweaking Mulligan's viral formula as a result of their recent legal debacles. The conclusion that they come to has a potential for great _lulz_ and also some win. Or fail, I suppose. Anyway, a big thanks as always to Alex our sound dude and Jace Ford our resident rock star. Also, the dozens of lady extras that came out to be a part of the episode.

Hit the jump to give it a watch.

As always, you can visit [Revision3](http://www.revision3.com/webzeroes/theredheadedmenace) to download other versions of the video. 

I have to say that I'm a big fan of both the beginning and the ending of this episode. The teaser in particular ranks among one of my favorites for the series, and I hope you all think so too. Thanks for watching, spread the word to your friends, and enjoy!
