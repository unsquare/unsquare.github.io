Well, I know that some of you are waiting for a trailer.  The sad news is that the trailer for Episode Seven isn't done.  However, the good news is that the actual episode is.  I thought that would be a good trade off.

So we now present to you dudes, the rad viewers, Episode Seven of The Leet World, "[Got Disappeared](http://www.smoothfewfilms.com/2007/11/28/got-disappeared/)".  We think this is one of our best yet.  Hope you like it.

By the way, digg-ing us really helps! [Click here to digg it!](http://digg.com/videos/gaming/The_Leet_World_Episode_7_Got_Disappeared)
