For those of you checking on the status of The Leet World, you should know that filming on Episode 1 is currently underway, and moving along quite well.  While we are going to keep things under wraps for the time being, you should know that some great things are happening as far as the look of the show...We are currently both filming and capturing at a native 720p resolution- that's right, things will be very pretty.  And it looks awesome.  Here's a [screenshot](http://sherman.unsquare.com/leetworld/ep1snapshot101tlw.jpg), if you're not convinced.  You should notice our logo in the lower right hand corner, as well as the fact that in comparison to the way we're shooting the show now, the trailer looks crude.  Next week, we'll post some pictures of the production process, and maybe another screenie or two.
