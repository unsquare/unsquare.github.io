Thanks for the great response to [Web Zeroes, Episode 2](http://smoothfewfilms.com/2008/11/16/writers-block/). Web Zeroes episodes are always a tad more nerve wracking to release because it really is putting a bit more of us out there than our machinima. I mean, obviously. But then again, you get to see Nick's beard, so I guess it all evens out. Were it not for that beard, perhaps many of you would have been turned off to the show's charm. Sometimes I want to wear it like a parka.

In other news, we are hard at work on the first few episodes of The Leet World, Season 2. Obviously, I don't want to spoil any kind of "secritz", but we're working on something fun for the first episode's release. Mark my words, you might get excited enough to punch a puppy when you see what I'm talking about. And not to leave you hanging with that tease, here's another one. Or three, to be exact:

Have fun with those. Those are like, sneaky James Bond style screenshots.

By the way, downloads for Web Zeroes are coming today at some point, we just got so caught up in working on Season 2 that we literally just forgot. I'm assuming we'll be forgiven for that. If not, tough enchiladas.
