![microphone](http://smoothfewfilms.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/microphone.jpg)And here it is, the [premiere episode](http://smoothfewfilms.com/2009/10/07/cast-aways/) of Web Zeroes on Revision 3, made by us dudes at Smooth Few Films. If you've seen the original episodes we made last year, you'll see a few bits that are familiar, along with lots of new ones. Like we've said, this is a reboot of the series, so it's different than the previous pilot we did. 

In this episode, Ray, Nate and Alex attempt to record a podcast as the start of their (hopeful) future stardom on the Web. This is our first episode launch, so things might be a tad spotty this time, but in the coming weeks we'll get the process all nailed down. Be sure to update your flash player to watch the embedded version, and for downloadable versions, simply visit [Revision3](http://revision3.com/webzeroes). 

We hope to have a premiere page for upcoming releases, but for now, hit the jump to see the first episode. Episode 2 will be out next Wednesday, October 14th!

Special thanks as always go to Jace, who scored the episode, as well as Alex, Chuck and LJ, our lovable crew who do this for nothing. 

In terms of really cool things that are kind of awesome and crazy, we were featured in the [Houston Chronicle](http://blogs.chron.com/peep/2009/10/going_for_zeroes_on_the_intern.html) today, an honest-to-goodness newspaper. Imagine that. Definitely some cool info there for you long time fans.

Anywho, watch the episode, comment and enjoy!
