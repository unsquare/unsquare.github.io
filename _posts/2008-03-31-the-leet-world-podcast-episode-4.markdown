Perhaps the title to this one should have been "It's about time". We wanted to do this next installment to the podcast a while back, but we decided that finishing [Episode 11](http://www.smoothfewfilms.com/2008/03/25/wrong-side-of-the-hax/) took precedence. I think you guys should really enjoy the wide variety of topics we cover in this edition of The Leet World podcast, clocking in at half an hour. A brief rundown of what you'll hear:

Our feelings on Episode 11, the original plan for the "hax" storyline, plans for the end of Season One (and future seasons), our summer project, fan questions about zombies, bloopers, how Daniel is Magneto, the origins of Rick-Rolling, The Portal Day, The Bag Boy, Law and Order: Street Justice and two upcoming Leet World fan contests!

Give it a listen, and enjoy. To download, right click the direct link and select "Save As".
