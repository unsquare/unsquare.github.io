![hunt](http://smoothfewfilms.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/hunt.jpg)Here's Season 2, Episode 12 of The Leet World, [I, Cyborg](http://smoothfewfilms.com/2009/07/11/i-cyborg/). This takes us right up to the edge of the finale, which will be a two parter to close out the series. Weird, huh?

So in this episode, the cast deals with some of Leeroy's more WTF-inducing revelations, namely that they've got a homicidal psycho killer cyborg living amongst them. Some guys say some things to each other, there's also some gun toting, a few chuckles, and even another WTF or two, because we throw those things out with no regard for human life. Or cyborg life, if that's your style.

Anywho, check out the [TLW premiere page](http://www.smoothfewfilms.com/premiere/) if you're looking for the higher res version of the episode, or just hit the jump to see the normal one.

Still hard to believe that after 2 years of work, this thing's almost over. Can't wait to finally wrap it up and move on to other things. Expect the next episode in 2-3 weeks, as always.

Much thanks to DJ Shox and Lord Ned for some late night Hammer FAQs and Jace for another killer soundtrack. He needs to score my life. It would rule.
