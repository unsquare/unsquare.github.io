If you're unaware, there are two super-cool things happening in the machinima world in November.



	
  * [Machinima Filmfest](http://festival.machinima.org/wordpress/) in New York. If you're interested in presenting your piece for a variety of awards including Best Short, Best Writing, Best Director, etc., you'd better get cracking.

	
  * [Machinima Expo](http://www.machinima-expo.com/) takes place in Montreal the very next week. There, selected works will be displayed to an audience of thousands.


For those machinimakers out there, this is a great chance to get some exposure and if you're in the area of these events, I'm sure they'd be cool to attend. I hope to attend Machinima Filmfest myself.

In other news, Jace has produced some hot Smooth Few Films shirts for Daniel and I to wear to PAX:

While these aren't for sale, you can still check out our [other shirts](http://www.smoothfewfilms.com/store) that are available. Also, if you haven't seen [Meet the Sandwich](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlwpQY-Tbls) yet, do yourself a favor and laugh your head off.
