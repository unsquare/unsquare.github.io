So there's a fun article over at [GamerSushi](http://gamersushi.com/2008/11/23/valve-gamings-best-storytellers/) about Valve, Half-Life 2, Portal, Left 4 Dead, and how Valve might be the best storytellers in the gaming business. [Go read it](http://gamersushi.com/2008/11/23/valve-gamings-best-storytellers/).

And now on to more important things...

We're ridiculously close to Season 2 of The Leet World. Stupid close, even. Perhaps _burro_ close, but that could be stretching it. As I've said before, whenever no posts are happening on the front page, that means that there's probably a lot going on in our silly machinima production realm. We're pounding away at finishing Episode 1, and we've even started doing some work on Episode 3 at this point.

There's also a new commercial from the CT's for you to watch. Those guys have been getting around lately, doing lots of promotions. Maybe the stress is getting to them? Soon though, they'll be back in their natural habitat. Video after the jump!

Enjoy!
