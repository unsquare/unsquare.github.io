The long wait is almost over.  Episode Nine of The Leet World releases next week!  As always, we're not going to commit to a specific date- but it will be here next week for sure.  All of the sweaty palms, fingernail biting, and general fretting will finally be over as you see what becomes of your favorite characters in the next half of Season One.  And trust me, we've got a lot of great stuff in store for this half.

I figured I'd bring you guys a couple more screenshots to help satiate your appetite, even if just slightly.  Also- there might be another special preview of Episode Nine during the weekend.   Just saying.
