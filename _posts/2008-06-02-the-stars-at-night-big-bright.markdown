A reminder for all of you slackers who haven't voted for the Themetacular Challenge yet â€” [go do it](http://www.smoothfewfilms.com/2008/05/26/themetacular-voting-begins/)! Voting ends tonight at midnight central standard time, when Texas rolls over from Monday into Tuesday, not unlike some lumbering, snoring giant. Since Texas is the center of the Earth, this makes perfect sense.

A bio is on the way this week as well as some other goodies in the near future. More screenshots from the Season Finale below. And if you haven't listened to the outtakes from Episode Thirteen yet, [go do that](http://www.smoothfewfilms.com/2008/05/30/the-angry-beard/).

More information is coming on the Season Finale soon, including release schedules, etc. I'd tell you more, but many Bothan spies have already died for that info.
