Just wanted to stop in and give a quick update about the progress of Episode 13, part 1 of the series finale. It's mostly in the can, with post production left in front of it. It should be out next week at some point. Don't hold me to that, though. We all know how I hate magical binding contracts. Especially when it comes to picking release dates. 

In other news, Daniel finally returns this weekend. He's been living it up and having fun in other places (read: touching butts) while Nick and I slave away at Leet World. But don't worry, we're not bitter. Much. Regardless, we'll be glad to have him back. There might be group hugs and/or beers to celebrate.

Besides all that, we're already working on stuff for Episode 14, which is part 2 of the series finale and hugely massive. Anywho, here are some screenshots from Episode 13.
