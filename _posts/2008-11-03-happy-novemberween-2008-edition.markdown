Wow, I've said it before, but lots of thanks to everyone who has been supporting us by purchasing the [TLW Season One Soundtrack](http://www.smoothfewfilms.com). It was a labor of much love by Jace. I think the coolest thing of all is that the people that are buying it seem to love it in a totally passionate want-to-touch kind of way.

All of that aside, it's been a long time since you've all seen or heard any shred of information concerning [the whereabouts of one Mr. Adam Sizlewski](http://smoothfewfilms.com/2008/07/31/the-case-of-adam-sizlewski/) (AKA Sizzler). Well, I figured I'd bring along a little teaser for Season 2 of The Leet World which finally reveals his location, and maybe ties up a few loose ends on the way.

Also, it tells you when to expect Season 2. Try not to hyperventilate, but it's cool if you are, I am too. Video after the jump!

Enjoy, and Happy Novemberween everyone.
