[![Producer](http://smoothfewfilms.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/producer.jpg)](http://smoothfewfilms.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/producer.jpg)Howdy and hello.

Thanks to everyone for all of the birthday wishes you gave us. It's great that so many of you are still around from the earliest days. Also fairly flattering. A special thank you to all the lurkers that came out of hiding to utter a few words of gratitude. Another weird anniversary is coming right on the heels of that one: next week marks a year since TLW ended.

In terms of news, the main thing I have to offer is for those of you who live in Texas. Next weekend, a cool thing called [Fantastic Fest](http://www.fantasticfest.com/) will be going down in Austin. It's a huge genre film festival, and from what I hear, it's pretty rad. Anyway, Rooster Teeth organized themselves a machinima panel, and they invited one of us to sit in on it. Since Daniel won the fist fight (it's the gangly arms), he gets to be on the panel with some other machinima dudes.

If you are anywhere nearby, the [Best of Machinima screening](http://fantasticfest.bside.com/2010/films/bestofmachinima_multiple_fantasticfest2010;jsessionid=1F8E1BDEFEE0AFD88C5D9A53E93A3BCA) will happen on Saturday, September 25 at 4 PM at the Alamo Drafthouse on South Lamar. They'll be showing Day in the Life of a Turret. Stop by and troll Daniel.

Also, because I'm nice, here's a free download of the Producer theme from the TLW soundtrack. Figured since the anniversary of his death is coming up and all, it only made sense. This is probably my favorite track on the whole thing. Enjoy!

In other news, did anyone get Halo: Reach? I'm loving it. Also, check out the new [GamerSushi](http://www.gamersushi.com/). Loving that, too.
