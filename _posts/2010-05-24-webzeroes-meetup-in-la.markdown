This past Sunday Nick and I were in Los Angeles and we thought it might be cool to get together with some fans of our work. We met at Kansas City BBQ in North Hollywood and Cristo, Max, and Theo showed up. We had a great time talking to them about all sorts of stuff ranging from music they like to the gut wrenching terror one feels when riding Tatsu at Magic Mountain. It was great to meet some people who liked what we do and hang out with them for a bit. Heres a picture for the guys.

Thanks for coming out, seriously.
