Yeah, I know I'm a day early but I'll be gone tomorrow, so I wanted to just leave a quick note for you guys. Episode 1 is racing to the finish line, and before you even know it, your eyes will be feasting on more of The Leet World story as it continues on into our second season. I've got to say, we're totally pumped about the overall direction this season is going, and we can't wait to jump into it with you guys.

In other news, the day that the premiere drops on the site will be an event, and you'll see what I mean when it happens. All I can say about that is that Nick and his beard are my heroes.

I'm going to be playing the junk out of Left 4 Dead this weekend in addition to getting fat. Can't wait!

Happy Turkey Day, dudes!
