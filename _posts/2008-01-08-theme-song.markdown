There are a lot of questions that we get asked repeatedly while producing our silly little internet series. Let's run through a few of them, shall we?

"When is (insert episode number) coming?"

"Can I be a voice?"

"Will you marry me?"

"Where can I download the theme song?"

For some reason, we've never posted the theme song to The Leet World here. I guess we were always busy, you know, making the show. Jace, aka Damn Dangerous writes the music for our series, and you can definitely check him out at [his myspace page](http://www.myspace.com/damndangerous)- add him as a friend, he likes those. You can also get the theme tune here:

I know you're all starving for Episode Nine details- but not yet. You will know more soon. For now, feel free to sign up for the forums, help us build our community, and re-watch your favorite episodes. Also, I have rounded up some of the best news tidbits of the last week or so from around the gaming industry:
