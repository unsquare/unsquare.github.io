![goodbye](http://smoothfewfilms.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/goodbye1.jpg)Man. Took us long enough, huh? 

The Leet World Series Finale, [Army of One Part 2](http://smoothfewfilms.com/2009/09/22/army-of-one-part-2/), is now available for your viewing pleasure. 

I have to admit, it's a little bittersweet to be presenting this one to you guys. While we're sad to see the show go, making a series of any kind is like slamming your testicular area in a car door, so we're happy that it's past us. It takes lots of grueling labor and a bit of a masochistic streak to make a show like this. Like that dude in the _Da Vinci Code_ who keeps whipping himself. Ah, self _flatulation_... wait, I think I got those words mixed up. 

Anyway, there's lots of stories we could tell you about these last two months and what all went into getting this episode up for you guys, and also what kept us from finishing it when we wanted to. Be sure to send lots of love to Jace, Nick and Daniel who kind of took one for the team in the last 24 hours to make this release date possible. 

So, check out the episode on the [TLW premiere page](http://smoothfewfilms.com/premiere/), or just hit the jump for the normal version.

Special thanks go to Tyler of [Young Street Productions](http://forecasttheseries.blogspot.com/) for providing a voice in this episode, as well as Gainesworthy, Lord Ned and DJ Shox for all of their Hammer and mapping tips. You probably won't notice it, but there are probably 10-15 different maps utilized in the finale alone. And as I mentioned before, Jace Ford deserves a big standing ovation for kicking this episode in the balls. Especially with the little number he did for the ending credits...

A lot of you guys are asking us what's next, and soon enough we'll be able to talk about the new show. In addition, we still plan on tackling the occasional machinima short, including a TLW short every now and then, so this isn't exactly a total goodbye to the characters in that regard. 

I have to say that all of us at SFF are really proud of this finale and what all goes on in it. Trying to nail an ending like this is a hard job, and we felt if we could pull it off without sucking it would be a big deal. I'd like to think we did so. Hopefully you agree. Once again, thanks so much for sticking with us and watching this ridiculous show. It's so beyond me that people actually like it, so we appreciate it. Stick around, there's more good stuff to come.

Enjoy!
