Ok, so I lied. It wasn't this weekend, it was actually sooner. I doubt you'll hold it against me for very long. Here's Episode 13 of Season 2 of The Leet World, [Army of One](http://smoothfewfilms.com/2009/07/31/army-of-one-part-1/), available for your review. 

In this episode, we continue to build up to the explosive series finale, which will be a rather exciting conclusion, if I do say so myself. Some guys argue, the Producer spills the beans, there are some cyborgs and perhaps a big surprise by the end. Re: the surprise, allow me to be the first to say it... Served.

To check out the high res version of the episode, mosey over to the [TLW premiere page](http://www.smoothfewfilms.com/premiere/). Or just hit the jump to see the regular version if you're not feeling up to its awesomeness.

I say it all the time, but Jace Ford is a titan among men. He is a Goliath on the music front. A _shagohod_, if you will. Simple machinima videos are not worthy of his tunes. If you can't tell, I think his music for this episode is just over in the badass category. 

The series finale should be out sometime in August, hopefully around the middle of the month. We've got a lot of stuff going down between now and then, so we'll see what happens. 

Remember that all comments go directly into moderation now. So if it's just a worthless pile of letters in Player lingo, it's gone. I feel little to no remorse about ejecting nonsense back into the ether from which it spawned. 

Enjoy!
