Well, production on the first episode of The Leet World continues, and there has definitely been a learning curve as we figure out how to get everything to look the way we want.  Trying to negotiate a game engine with new equipment (hi def brings its own set of challenges) has been a fun experience, and we're making headway everyday.  For a quick idea of what we're dealing with, we're posting some shots of our set-up.

At one point, we had 7 computers in here.  We really need an office or something.  We'll keep you guys posted about the progress- as of now we're finished filming and doing audio- all that's left is editing ,minor tweaks, and getting some music laid in.  Thanks for all the support so far, and keep spreading the word about The Leet World.
