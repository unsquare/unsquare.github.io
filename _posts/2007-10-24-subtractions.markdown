Well, Daniel and Nick are heading off to California today, leaving me all to my lonesome.  To be honest, a small break from all The Leet World fracas will be welcome.  No more of Daniel and Nick being smelly and fat in my apartment.  While they're gone, I thought I'd give you guys something to chew on.  Here's two deleted scenes from Episode Five.  You might watch these and wonder "why did they cut these?", but in reality, when it was all laid out together, the episode was just way, way too long.  It's in a completely unfinished state, as you might notice by the mono audio, green screens, and lack of color correcting.
