Howdy, gents and ladies.

Wanted to say a big thank you to all the supportive comments we received on that last post. There will probably be some changes coming to the site over the next few months, so stay tuned for that.

I mainly wanted to post a bit of music that Jace did. Basically, it's the TLW theme in 8 bit. I kind of love it. I'm sure you will, too.
