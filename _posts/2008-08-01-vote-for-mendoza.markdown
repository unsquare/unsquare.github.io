Ty, our resident thespian and the voice of Mendoza in The Leet World, has entered a contest for AMC's hit show "Mad Men". The winner scores a trip to Los Angeles and gets to appear in an episode of Season 3 of the show. Obviously, this is a pretty cool contest with a sweet prize.

Voting ends in September, but you can go ahead and head over to Ty's submission and lend your support right now. He is looking rather dapper and gives one heck of a performance.

We are going to be shooting Web Zeroes, our live-action mockumentary, over the weekend. Kind of wild considering we've been planning this since around March. Hopefully we'll have some pictures on Sunday.

Also, it was sweet to see everyone get pumped up about the [mysterious Sizlewski case](http://www.smoothfewfilms.com/2008/07/31/the-case-of-adam-sizlewski/). More on that soon. You are like the most rabid of dogs for anything related to TLW. It is both wonderful and terrifying.
