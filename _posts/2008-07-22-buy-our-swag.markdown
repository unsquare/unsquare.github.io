I mentioned we'd have one or two other surprises coming up soon...

Introducing: [The Leet World Store](http://www.smoothfewfilms.com/store/), where you can get your first ever [TLW shirts](http://www.smoothfewfilms.com/store/)!

Right now the selection is pretty limited, but this is just a trial run. Currently, the only colors we can offer are red, white, military green, brown and charcoal for the guys, blue, pink and yellow for the ladies. I'm partial to the green and brown, myself.

It should be noted that since we're going through [Cafepress](http://www.cafepress.com) (for now), any issues you have with ordering, delivery, etc, should be taken up with them.

A quick note about the price/selection of the shirts... Our available merch is going to be limited at first until we get an idea of the demand. If it turns out that there is a big enough demand for these shirts, we should be able to offer a wider selection of shirts (catch phrases, etc) and have more flexibility on pricing. At the moment, we are limited as to what kinds of products we can offer and the pricing points we can set. This is step one in a several step process. Happy browsing!

In other news, Jace is hard at work on the Season One soundtrack, and what I've heard is exceptional. In addition, the first episode commentary should be up within a couple of days.
