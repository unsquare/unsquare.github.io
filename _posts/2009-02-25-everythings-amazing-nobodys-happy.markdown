Saw this great clip yesterday from [Conan O'Brien and Louis CK](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoGYx35ypus). I find it to be an absurdly funny rant about the culture we live in. More specifically, I think it actually offers a witty, insightful, sobering depiction of the Internet in general.

All web content creators can probably identify with this in some way, in terms of people feeling entitled to things they weren't aware of until 10 seconds ago. Create on you crazy web pioneers, with those megabyte wagons rolling along. Watch out for the dysentery, though. [On the trail](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Oregon_Trail_(computer_game)), it's a killer.



EDIT: Our hosting provider is experiencing some issues tonight, so the site could range from slow to not working. Should be back soon!
