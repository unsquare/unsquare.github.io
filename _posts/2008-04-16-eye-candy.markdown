Episode Twelve is coming within a week. Unfortunately, I can't give any more details than that, but it's on its way and ready to be watched. If you haven't had a chance, get to reading [Leeroy's Bio](http://www.smoothfewfilms.com/2008/04/14/leeroy-a-nerds-path/) and find out more about your favorite nerd.  Some brand new screenies:

While Daniel and Nick are working their post-production surgery on Episode Twelve, I'm busy putting together (writing, building in Forge, etc) our next Halo short. Here are some early screenies of the location, from the new map "Blackout".
