It's an update.

Now that the [Season Finale](http://www.smoothfewfilms.com/2008/06/17/death-comes-home/) has come and gone, I must say we're pretty pleased with the results. Much thanks to you guys for all the thoughtful comments/ encouragement/ criticism that you left, it was definitely really cool for us to read. It's nice to be on break for a couple of weeks, but that doesn't mean the content is going to stop. On the burner right now:



	
  * **Season Finale Outtakes**


These should be up by the end of the week. I'm going to get cranking on the 50 or so audio files (that's right, 50) that make up parts 1, 2 and 3 of the Finale. There's a lot of good stuff in there.

	
  * **Episode Commentaries**


Starting next week we'll be adding episode commentaries by Nick, Daniel and myself.  We'll be doing this every week until we're finished. There's a chance you might get one or two eps worth of commentary per week, but I'm not making any promises.

	
  * **Podcast**


We really wanted to have one of these ready when the season ended, but Daniel's absence kept that from happening until now. He gets back in tomorrow. Much celebration will ensue.

There are other assorted surprises that you guys will see soon enough, so don't go anywhere.
