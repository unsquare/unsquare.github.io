We now present to you Season 2, Episode 10, [Wake Me Up Before You Go](http://smoothfewfilms.com/2009/06/05/wake-me-up-before-you-go/). This is a pretty big one, and you'll see why when you watch it. Next to Episode 7 and the Finale, it's maybe the biggest of the season. Be careful when reading comments, as there will be spoilers run amok. We even disabled the "recent comments" feature on the sidebar in order to prevent accidental spoil-age.

In this episode, we see what happens when Asher goes rogue, and the consequences unleashed upon the cast. Be sure to check out the wicked [TLW Premiere Page](http://www.smoothfewfilms.com/premiere/) to watch a higher res version. Clear your cache if the page is still showing the old episode.

Or just hit the jump to see the normal version!

**6/7 EDIT: A few have mentioned that the audio mix had some issues. It's updated now. Watch the episode again!**

This concludes the third arc (out of four) for the season. The final chapter of this saga is three episodes long, which puts us ending the show at about Episode 13 for this season. If that changes, we'll let you know.

I have to say that it was hard for me to hand off writing this arc to JJ because of this episode in particular, but he came through with flying colors. I think it might be the best so far of the season, if not one of the best yet. So be sure to thank him for being awesome. Also, thank Damn Dangerous for being a badass and delivering some more superb music. 

Episode 11 will be up in a couple of weeks. It's hard to tell, since Daniel's out of town, but we'll do our best. Between now and then, we'll be discussing the events of this episode in a more in-depth manner.

Enjoy!
