Happy November, guys and gals.

Just wanted to stop in say it was great to see everyone's comments on The Last Word. As I said before, I think Daniel did a spectacular job on it, and it shows. It's a touching short, and something I'm particularly fond of.

Anyway, I promise there will be a couple of regular posts here in the next couple of weeks, including a range of topics that we still get asked a lot of questions about. I've been terribly busy with some other things going on personally, and that looks to clear up in the next week or two. But for now, enjoy another free track from the TLW soundtrack.

This one is the Domination Man's theme from Episode 8 of TLW. You know, the one that plays during the entire cheesy GMod log fiasco and the zany antics surrounding that. I'm a big fan of what Jace did when he built this out for the soundtrack. I think you will be, too.

One of the things people keep asking about is if there's a way to still buy the soundtrack. Right now, the answer to that is no. Basically, sales had diminished over the last few months to where it was more expensive to keep the store going than it was to just take it down. If you hang around, we'll just be releasing it every week for free from here on out.

In other news, who out there has played Black Ops? Thoughts? We reviewed it up on [GamerSushi](http://gamersushi.com/2010/11/14/review-call-of-duty-black-ops/) and I've been dying to play it.
