Tonight or tomorrow, there will be a new short up from Smooth Few Films.  While this short is not "The Leet World" related, I think you guys will really enjoy it.  Also, its release officially marks the end of our break from The Leet World.  While we've already done just a little for Episode Nine, production will ramp up in full force after today.  I thought that would make you gents and gals happy to know.

Also, if you're up for watching a Hitchcockian Half Life 2 machinima, [check out this nifty piece from Xanatos](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5AMS_bMcQA), a respected member of the machinima community, as well as one of our own forum-goers.
