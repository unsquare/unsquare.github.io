![mic](http://smoothfewfilms.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/02/mic.jpg)Since Daniel was out of town this weekend, Nick and I did some general house cleaning in terms of production, so that was good. It's really nice to be ahead this season, and you'll probably hear me say that over and over again for the next couple of months.

If there was anyway to let you understand the amount of pure _getting kicked in the nuts_ factor that last season's workload caused for us, I would demonstrate it for you, believe me. But alas, these cursed Intertubes don't permit that kind of data transfer.

As promised, here are the outtakes from Episodes 3 and 4 of the new TLW season. You know the drill. Us goofing around, messing up, trying to make each other laugh while recording audio, etc. Also, Daniel almost dies.
