[![](http://smoothfewfilms.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/austin.jpg)](http://smoothfewfilms.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/austin.jpg)Here is Episode 13 of Web Zeroes, [the Season Finale](http://smoothfewfilms.com/2009/12/30/season-finale/). We do hope you guys enjoy it. It's definitely a great feeling to be done with yet another season of a Web series we made, the third in just 2 years of doing this. A bit insane, really.

In this episode, the guys attempt to stop Ray from going to his job interview in Austin. There's some RPG talk, a repeat appearance from a hobo, and a special cameo from the good dudes over at [RoosterTeeth](http://www.roosterteeth.com/). Special thanks to them for taking the time to appear in our silly Web show. 

Big props to Jace for this week's music. I love the RPG feel of a lot of it. There are places that even remind me of Final Fantasy 7, which is not a bad thing in the slightest. Also, a huge thanks to all of our friends who helped us out over the season, and for Alex and Chuck, our sound and camera dudes who gave up their weekends for nothing in return.

Remember to vote for us for the [Streamys](http://smoothfewfilms.com/2009/12/19/vote-web-zeroes-for-the-streamy-awards/) if you haven't done so yet. And to watch the episode, just hit the jump.
