![Lost Supper](http://smoothfewfilms.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/lost-supper.jpg)I know I've said it quite a bit, but I truly am sorry for the lack of updates. It's crazy, because in checking our site statistics regularly, there really are quite a few of you who come here every single day only to be disappointed by my failure to sit down and type some words about how we continually make fools of ourselves on the IntarWebz. Apparently there is a market for this kind of thing.

In terms of Web Zeroes, we are currently working on episodes 3 and 4 of the second season, doing our best to keep a steady pace without murdering ourselves. The show should debut in the next few weeks, though we haven't quite nailed a date down with Revision3 just yet. This is part of the reason I've waited to update, simply because there wasn't much news to give you guys. Also, it's hard to show too many screenshots without spoiling some of the developments that we left hanging at the end of Season 1, so that makes it a tad difficult, too.

During my free time, I've found myself starting a fantasy novel of sorts. I'm not exactly sure why I'm sharing that, really, but it's certainly interesting to me even if it's not interesting to anyone else. One of the things the guys and I have talked about recently is that while we don't miss the workload and the tedium that came from working on a machinima production like The Leet World, we do actually miss the ability to tell a ridiculous tale that really had no rules. While Web Zeroes is ultimately more rewarding to make, we wish that we had the budget to make a live action epic on par with the zaniness seen by our small corner of the Web. I suppose writing my own fantasy stories lets me get that out of my system. Who knows, maybe some day you can buy one. Or not.

Lately, I've been completely consumed by the final season of Lost on ABC. It really is a fantastic and wild show, and the engrossing mystery has had me enthralled for some time. In the final season, I'm finding myself both overjoyed and enraged by the way the questions refuse to be answered, yet trying to not worry and just appreciate the ride while it lasts. Honestly, I can't imagine seeing anything else quite like this on TV ever again. However, it got me wondering about the mystery we wove on our own goofy Counter-Strike: Source show. Did you guys ever find yourselves frustrated by the way it unraveled? 

More news on Web Zeroes coming _very_ soon. In addition, some more "lost" info of Leet World will be revealed, as well as some old school outtakes. Hope you all are doing well, and thanks for being great fans.
