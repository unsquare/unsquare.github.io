Meant to get this up earlier, but my internet died tonight...

Though we had our share of problems over the weekend, we are for the most part unscathed. I must say that Hammer is the bane of my existence, currently. Besides that though, Episode Twelve is still trucking along. Should have some more extras and screens up this week.

In my last post I mentioned that we would hopefully be adding some cool new content to the website over the weekend. A "virtual nerdery" were my exact words. Well, the bulk of that will be coming at a later date, but I thought I'd present a small piece of it to you right now.

Starting once a week, I'll be posting up a character bio of one character from The Leet World, which should take us through the end of the season. This week's character bio: Ahmad.

**Name: Ahmad**
**Age: 19**
**Team: Terrorists**
**Position: Noob**

Ahmad has led a rather quirky life. The weirdness began at an early age. He was born to a poor family and never knew his father- he left "for a quick vacation", as Ahmad's mother put it. Unfortunately, at the tender age of 4, Ahmad was kicked out of several day cares for biting children and exhibiting over-aggressive behavioral patterns. This forced his mother to homeschool him for the next 14 years of his life, imparting all of her wisdom to him. Oh, and pampering him.

Ahmad learned to suppress his rage by the time he entered his grade school years. He covered his anxiety and angst with phrases like "cool", and "awesome", even when things were neither cool nor awesome. By the time he was 10, he was diagnosed with a severe case of ADHD, one of the worst his doctor had ever seen. The heavily medicated Ahmad soon found great success in the classroom, and continued to break the curve, even though his classroom consisted only of himself and his neighbor Petrov, the Eastern European boy from across the street that always had to use crutches.

Making friends is often difficult for normal children, but for boys like Ahmad it was nigh on impossible. He frequently attempted to join the neighborhood clubhouses, but his friendships were soon broken or forsaken. Being friends with Ahmad was like being paper cut to death or having your testicles put under an iron. Over time, Ahmad taught himself to ignore any social awkwardness, forcing himself to become completely unaware of when he was ruining things like conversations, lives and other people's happiness.

One fateful day, Ahmad was watching other boys have fun though his telescope (as he was wont to do) while they played a game of "cops and robbers". Cautiously observing them, he noted that the "robbers" were free from rules and regulations. They seemed to be so happy. He thought that if he never followed those rules again, he could have fun, and maybe even find himself some friends.

Dumping his medication, Ahmad became a bother in the classroom and at home, trying to learn the ways of terrorists and shooting counter-terrorists. Kicked out of multiple groups for his lack of skill, the young man never gave up. Finally, at the age of 19, he saw an advertisement to audition for The Leet World and then left home for good in order to pursue his dreams.
