So it looks like the next few weeks of my life will be absorbed by either Hammer or Faceposer. No, I can't tell you why. But here's a hint: it's for TLW. In case you missed the update, Episodes 6 and 7 are going to mark the halfway point for Season 2. Stuff is about to go down. For real.

Anywho, we've got a new TLW based short coming out this weekend, and Episode 6 will be dropping sometime next week. Get excited. There are a lot of fun elements in every aspect of production for the next two episodes, ranging from sound design to color correcting and Hammer work. I'm just pumped about how the end products are going to turn out.

There's a chance many of you have already seen Cortez's cameo in [Source Wars](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yTZlKkdpd2M), made by Xanatos and crew, but if you haven't, you should give it a watch. Xanatos did this with our permission, and he's a bud of ours, so I was happy to lend my voice. It's pretty goofy, but definitely good for some laughs.
