It's been a machinima filled weekend for us. Mostly in filming Episode 3, of which I'll have some screenshots up shortly. Also wrote the Christmas special yesterday, and we'll be working on that some this week before we break a little while for the holidays. 

A couple of machinima videos for you to watch. First, there's [Clear Skies](http://www.machiniplex.net/?id=29), a production by Ian Chisolm which uses the Source engine and EVE Online. Lots of good stuff there. Very impressive Hammer/GMod work. 

Secondly, a few weeks ago I posted about [OneSharedVision](http://www.onesharedvision.com/), a machinima community effort to promote the charity [Child's Play](http://www.childsplaycharity.org). Anywho, [Dave Tyner](http://vimeo.com/user450233) made this week's video and it kind of rules. Unreal squaring off against Halo, "You Got Served" style. A tad bit of language, so be warned. 



Our video for this will appear next week. If you hadn't guessed, it's the Christmas Special.
