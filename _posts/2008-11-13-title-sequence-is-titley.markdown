Seriously. Horde mode on Gears of War 2 is ruining my life. And I mean that in the best way possible. Also, I checked out the Left 4 Dead demo, and left some impressions on [GamerSushi](http://www.gamersushi.com/)... I was a little underwhelmed by it, but it was still lots of fun. I mean, it's Valve, so you know it's good.

This is basically just a quick update to show you guys a little screen grab from the title sequence Daniel is working on for Season 2 of The Leet World. It features the lovable Westheimer, striking a sexy pose.

Keep in mind this is a work in progress, and I'd like to remind you how the Web Zeroes title sequence changed from the original screenshot I showed way back when. Anywho, feast your eyes upon it and be teased.

And speaking of Web Zeroes, Episode 2 of that will be up before you know it. Or maybe after. I can never tell. We're sneaky that way.
