![](http://www.smoothfewfilms.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/09/growing_pains-300x224.jpg)As you may have heard, [a vast army of elves](http://www.smoothfewfilms.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/03/sffpic05.jpg) is currently toiling 24/7 to bring you a brand-new [Smooth Few Films website](http://smoothfewfilms.com).

In the process of doing this, the existing Leet World website may start misbehaving or looking funny, and there will definitely be an unknown period of time where both sites will be down while I have to do a bit of behind-the-scenes magic and make sure everything is in working order before we open it back up to the public. Hopefully the downtime won't take too long.

This is just a friendly note to let everyone know that you shouldn't freak out if our site is down / broken / etc. today and tomorrow. We hope to have everything back to regularly scheduled programming on Monday (September 8th).

NOTE: Kirk Cameron not included.
