Glad to see that the Episode One commentary went over so well. We recorded three episodes at the same time, so now, here's the bright shiny new Episode Two commentary for your listening enjoyment.

Once again, we offer a countdown at the beginning to help you know when to start the episode. I can't imagine it makes much sense unless you're watching the episode simultaneously. Personally, I think we did a better job on this one than on the first. Hopefully you guys enjoy it, too.

Remember, right-click and select "save as" to download it.

If you don't have Episode Two downloaded, you can stream it from [YouTube](http://youtube.com/watch?v=UfXT4TW6yq8) or [here](http://www.smoothfewfilms.com/2007/08/22/dirty-deeds/).

In other news, now that we've had some time to kind of chill and get our thoughts together, we're moving into pre-production for some of the other properties that we've recently mentioned. Over the next couple of weeks you guys should be hearing a lot more about G.R.I.E.F. and Web Zeroes.

Also, if you haven't seen The Dark Knight yet, go do it. I publicly declare that my man-crush on Christian Bale has only been strengthened in light of its release. And, in order to save my manhood after that statement, I shall add: Dude. Bra.
