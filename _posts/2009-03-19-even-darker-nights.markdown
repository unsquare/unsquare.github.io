![hype-train1](http://smoothfewfilms.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/hype-train1.jpg)Episode 7 should be gracing your monitors at some point next week, and we couldn't be more excited. I'm not trying to get the hype train going overboard or anything, but I'll admit that I've been looking forward to this episode since we started working on the season. When you're working on a long term project like this, it takes a Herculean effort to not get ahead of yourself when you've got cool things down the road. I think we've done a decent job of it so far.

Anywho, some surprises are in store for the cast (and you dudes) in Episode 7, to say the least. You might pick up on one or two through the screenshots, or maybe there's nothing there at all and I just want to make your brains hurt. Both of these things are possible.

Enjoy!
