Your friendly webmaster here, with a quick update...

Although it took me a little longer than I thought it would, I've hacked together an iTunes podcast feed. Here's the link:

[![Feed Icon](http://www.smoothfewfilms.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/10/feed-icon-14x14.png) http://www.smoothfewfilms.com/wp-rssvideo.php](http://www.smoothfewfilms.com/wp-rssvideo.php)

This feed will work in any RSS reader, but if you plug it into a podcast-ready program like iTunes, it will automatically download the newest episode of The Leet World in our iPod-ready format. Subscribe to your heart's content!
