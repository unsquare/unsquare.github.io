![faq](http://smoothfewfilms.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/faq.jpg)It really is nice to have the Web Zeroes announcement out in the open. We've been working our butts off on the rebooted version of the series for a couple of months now to make the Fall release date.

The support coming in from you guys and from other places has been really awesome for us, especially after giving our all to get that TLW Finale up. Thanks for that. We even got some nice props from [Burnie Burns](http://redvsblue.com/members/journal/entry.php?id=2462875), of a little outfit known as Rooster Teeth.

In recent days, JJ has updated the trusty [SFF FAQ page](http://smoothfewfilms.com/faq/). We're still taking some questions, so send them in. A few of you have been asking some questions about the new show. So I thought I'd answer those and a few more below the jump:
<!-- more -->




	
  * **What about the old episodes of Web Zeroes?**


We're rebooting the show, so they're gone. Lost in the vacuum of the Internet. If you really wanted to download them, you had a chance to do so for about a year. But you are lazy. 

	
  * **What's with the "reboot"?**


When we started making Web Zeroes, it was really just a test. We loved the idea, didn't have many long term plans for it, and just wanted to make something that was uniquely ours. Pretty soon, we realized that the machinima angle was a bit too constricting, and there was a better way to open up the show more to give it more options: namely, that Alex, Ray and Nate would try anything and everything to get famous, and not just making movies with video games. They will still talk a lot about video games and will dabble in machinima, but it won't be the only thing they do.

This gives us a lot more places to go with the story, and will make for a better series, I think. We discussed doing this kind of reboot anyway, and when Revision 3 came calling it gave us the perfect opportunity to start the series off again, with a better focus. That being said, not all of the old jokes/scenes are gone, and a few of them will find their way back into the first few episodes of the season. Other than that, the show is almost entirely the same. Except for the laser-eyed sharks.

	
  * **How often will the show come out?**


Web Zeroes is going to be a weekly show, starting October 7th. You'll be able to watch episodes here, on Revision 3, on YouTube, on iTunes and even Tivo if you really wanted to. Pretty much anywhere you can think of, our episodes will be there. It will even be at your mom's house. We go there often.

	
  * **TLW Season 2 Soundtrack plox?**


Jace has done some work on it, but we're not sure when it will be out. We're focusing on Web Zeroes at the moment. Believe me, I want to listen to it as badly as you guys do. For future information, plox has become the word that we associate with mental disabilities.

	
  * **What about the TLW outtakes and making-of video?**


We'd still love to release that stuff in the next couple of months. Right now we're so swamped with Web Zeroes that it's just not really on the radar. To give you an idea, we're currently working on six episodes at once. Eight if you count the two that Jeff and I are writing. Once we finally feel like we've got some breathing room, I definitely want to start working on those outtakes and show you guys some of the behind-the-scenes footage from TLW.

I think that about does it for now. That's about as specific as I can be with Web Zeroes and our future plans. In terms of when there will be more machinima stuff, who knows? I hear Dragon Age: Origins is going to have some robust machinima tools, as well as Uncharted 2. We'll see about that in the near future. Right now, though, we've got a sweet deal to do what we love, and that is live action content. 

P.S. You guys have heard that the dude who made Counter-Strike is making a new game called Tactical Intervention, right?
