![](http://smoothfewfilms.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/09/ike.jpg)Just an FYI, in the event that we don't post for a few days, there's no need to fear. It's just that measly old hurricane Ike is bearing down to [swallow up our fair coast of Texas](http://www.weather.com/maps/news/atlstorm9/floater3_large_animated.html?from=hp_main_maps). Ground zero happens to be Houston, which is where we're located.

So if I do in fact lose power and am unable to update til early next week, just know that you guys rule. For real, thanks for all the great feedback on Web Zeroes.

Some cool stuff coming next week.

**UPDATE, 5pm Saturday**: This is your friendly webmaster, Jeff, speaking. I've just heard from Eddy, and both he and Nick made it through the storm alright (Daniel lives in Dallas, and I live in Austin). Eddy asked me to go ahead and update the site so that folks wouldn't be worried about them. Eddy and Nick are both without power at the moment, but hopefully things will be back up and running in a day or two. I'll keep you posted on here if there are further developments.
