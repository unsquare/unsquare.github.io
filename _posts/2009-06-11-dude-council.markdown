![lotr](http://smoothfewfilms.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/lotr.jpg)A huge thanks to all of you TLW-ites who watched and commented on Episode 10, [Wake Me Up Before You Go](http://smoothfewfilms.com/2009/06/05/wake-me-up-before-you-go/). Some mighty wild things happened in that episode, things we've been planning for quite some time. We'll hopefully get into that more in the next couple of days (once a few more of you have had a chance to watch it), and have some cool character discussions.

Daniel's out of town right now, but Nick and I have been working diligently to keep the machine moving. Currently, we're in the midst of several things such as faceposing, Hammer-ing and editing Episode 11. Also, I'm working on getting a final draft for Episode 12. It's certainly both madness and Sparta, but I think it helps that we can see the light at the end of the tunnel.

The next episode is interesting in that it's kind of the "Council of Elrond" episode. Lots of information. Maybe you understand that nerdy reference, maybe you don't. Either way, here are some screenshots.

Spooky, scary. In other news, I plan to get some outtakes done soon, but the last couple of episodes have been faceposer/Hammer heavy, and I figured you would all appreciate me helping get the episodes out faster rather than working on those. And yes, those things are mutually exclusive.
