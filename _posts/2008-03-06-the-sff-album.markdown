This post is more like an album than a post, in that it is supplied with many pictarz.  What is so interesting about these pictures?  Well, the first set is a few nifty shots from Episode Eleven, complete with some nice teases.  Take a gander:

These next shots are to show you a little about the process that goes behind The Leet World.  If you didn't know-- Nick, Daniel, and myself are the three that put this show together.  We meet up a few times a week in a room filled with computers (6 to be exact) and make this series at your urging whip cracks, shouts, threats and demands.

It's not a glamorous ordeal by any means.  In fact, if you were with us while we filmed, edited, etc, you would probably find yourself bored to tears.  But nonetheless, here is a behind-the-scenes view at Smooth Few Films.

In the first three shots below, you can see 3 of our "actor" computers, which we use as characters in the scene. Picture two shows Daniel and Nick setting up a shot, and the third shows me and Nick pretending to be friends. Nick's not a great actor.  The last three are just more shots of us doing our thing.
