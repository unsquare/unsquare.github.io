![tlwpromo1](http://smoothfewfilms.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/tlwpromo1.jpg)A few weeks back, I posted a feature called [The Lost TLW Factoids](http://smoothfewfilms.com/2009/10/12/the-lost-tlw-factoids-part-1/), which included bits and fragments of things that you guys never knew about your favorite Counter-Strike:Source machinima. We received lots of great feedback and some awesome questions. I didn't quite get to some of those questions this time, but I do plan on it. I just thought these tidbits were a little juicier. 

Here are some more lost TLW factoids.




	
  * _The clusterf*** of Episode 12._ A little known fact about Episode 12 of Season 1- it was re-written no less than 3 times during filming. One of the earliest concepts of the episode actually included Ahmad assuming leadership of the Terrorists, because let's get real, why would he let Cortez stay as the leader? This presented some funny ideas (like him making Cortez do the chores introduced in Ep 2), but ultimately we decided that we needed to get to the Ochos Muertos, because we had taken too long to bring them to the forefront. The original draft also didn't involve the Domination Man, but we eventually included him just because we thought it would be cool. Which lead to other problems... 






	
  * _The Domination Man's Early Demise._ Sometimes red herrings are cool. Other times they are not. Like when they distract you from the real plot and confuse the audience. While introducing the Domination Man to save Cortez in Episode 12, we ran into an unfortunate problem- most everyone that saw the episode thought that the Domination Man _was_ in fact Mendoza. From a storytelling standpoint, this makes perfect sense. Leeroy is talking about Mendoza, Cortez's brother, and then the very next scene, the Domination Man is heard while we see the logo of the Ocho Muertos, and then he saves Cortez. Suddenly, we were worried that Episode 13 wasn't going to make any sense and that people were just going to assume for the rest of the season that DM and Mendoza were one in the same. So... we wrote a quick scene where Mendoza kills him. Boom, end of confusion.






	
  * _Leeroy's Death._ This was one that I regretted cutting from the story badly, but we just couldn't make it work without it being stupidly confusing. Instead of getting kicked off the show by the Producer, Leeroy was going to be killed after the second challenge of Season 2, in either a crazy awesome explosion of his lair, or a shootout with Cortez. The death would send Westheimer spiraling into depression, and Ellis on the run at a slightly earlier time than he eventually did in the series proper. The twist? Leeroy had merely faked his death and went to study the death room. Cortez was in on it, too. We decided it was easier just to have him kicked off, because we thought that a fake death would lessen the impact of Ahmad's sacrifice when it happened. Also, before we had fully fleshed out Leeroy's arc for Season 2, it was going to be the Domination Man that appeared half dead on the house's doorstep, spilling the Producer and Player's secrets. Ever wonder why we didn't show him getting shot?






	
  * _Darth Westy._ When we did the initial brainstorming for the end of Season 2 and story for Season 3, we had 2-3 ideas that we toyed around with but ultimately scrapped. I'll save the others for a later date, but one of them involved the house exploding with Westheimer trapped inside. The rest of the cast has fled, assuming him dead. Right before the credits roll, a half dead and burned Westy is found by the Producer, who kneels down and whispers, "Do not worry, Westheimer. We are going to fix you." You can only guess who the main villain of Season 3 was going to be in that scenario.



Got any more questions that you're curious about? Send them in, and let us know your thoughts on these new revelations. Also, we've got a new episode of Web Zeroes out tomorrow, so be sure to stop by.
