[![working](http://smoothfewfilms.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/working.jpg)](http://smoothfewfilms.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/working.jpg)That is us. We are hard working dudes when we are not being geeks. In fact, in the midst of devoting nearly all of our time to the new mystery project, we've managed to accidentally finish filming the TLW Finale. Go figure. Does that mean it's coming out soon? 

Soon-_ish_. We've still got lots of post-production stuff to do, not to mention Jace writing the music. But we're getting closer. I'll let you know when we're about a week out. Believe me, nobody wants this thing out worse than us. But as I've said, the new project takes precedence, so we're doing all that we can to make sure we can work on both of those without hurting the new one. 

We've put an extensive bit of time into the finale so that it offers a satisfying conclusion and doesn't leave you guys hanging. We're happy with how it's going to end. It wraps up the story pretty well, since there's a chance we might not get to work on the movie for a long time, if at all. 

In terms of the new project, Jace is actually flying down to help us with it next weekend, and even JJ, our kindly Web master and TLW co-writer is going to join. It'll be the second time that all of Smooth Few Films has been together since TLW started, so that is worth a _hell yeah_ or two, if you're feeling wild. I really can't wait to do some show and tell with you guys, and I apologize for all of the vague language. Just know that we're working hard and we appreciate you dudes for hanging out with us. 

Also, Batman: Arkham Asylum is awesome. That is important to know, too. Just saying.
