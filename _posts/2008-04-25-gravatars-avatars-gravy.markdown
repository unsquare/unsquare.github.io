You may have noticed something different in the comments section of our site - little user icons are showing up next to each comment. Most folks are showing up as little grey heads, but a handful have user pictures, and YOU CAN TOO. It's dead simple... just go to [http://gravatar.com/](http://gravatar.com/) and sign up for an account with your email address.

Now whenever you leave a comment on a Gravatar-enable site and enter in the email address you configured on the Gravatar site, the user icon you selected will show up next to your comment. It's one more way to make your comments stand out, and I think it's a cool little feature.

You don't have to register for an account on our site for this feature to work, and it'll also work retroactively, so your user icon will appear next to any of the comments you've already made using the same email address.

Cheers,
Your Friendly Neighborhood <del>Spiderman</del> Webmaster
