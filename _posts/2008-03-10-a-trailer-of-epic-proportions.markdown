The Leet World is a reality show about Counter-Terrorists and Terrorists facing off against one another, to determine which team is the best of all.  A season consists of three challenges.  The first team to win two challenges (out of three), become the victors for the season.

The Counter-Terrorists have already won once.   Can they pull it off again?  For more reasons than one, a lot is on the line in Episode Eleven.  We were kind enough to provide you guys with a trailer. Enjoy!
