Episode Six is nearing completion, and will be out later this week.  What's funny is that as far as production goes, this has been the fastest we have ever gotten an episode completed.  Though it doesn't appear that way from the outside, we are getting more efficient, and doing this in far less time- but since October was a month of hell (for me) and vacations (for Nick and Daniel), it has just taken longer to get the episode released.

Also- Episode Seven should be released in November as well.

And while you wait, check out some interesting video game news for the week: [Call of Duty 4 Reviews are trickling out](http://pc.ign.com/articles/832/832795p1.html), [South Park goes Guitar Hero tonight](http://www.southparkstudios.com/show/episodes/display_episode.php?episodeid=1113), [Gray Fox ninjas his way onto SSBB](http://wii.advancedmn.com/article.php?artid=11063),  [Zero Punctuation reviews Phantom Hourglass](http://www.escapistmagazine.com/articles/view/editorials/zeropunctuation/2608-Zero-Punctuation-Zelda-Phantom-Hourglass), and [Super Mario Galaxies rocks](http://wii.ign.com/articles/833/833298p1.html).
