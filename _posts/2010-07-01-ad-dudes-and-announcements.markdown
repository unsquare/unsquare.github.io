[![Mad Men](http://smoothfewfilms.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/mad-men.jpg)](http://smoothfewfilms.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/mad-men.jpg)After a couple of weeks off to catch back up on the show, we now return with Episode 24 of Web Zeroes, [Adverse Effects](http://smoothfewfilms.com/2010/07/01/adverse-effects/). In this episode, we see the guys deal with the surprise of incorporating ads into their show, and what all that means for the road ahead. Naturally, there are schemes and jokes, and things continue to progress with Alex's co-workers as well, which will lead up to a spectacular season finale, if I do say so myself. 

Many big thanks to [JJ](http://twitter.com/unsquare/), who penned a great episode yet again. Also, I'd like to give a shout out to Miguel, who plays Scott, and did a fantastic job. Give those two guys a hand, as well as [Jace](http://twitter.com/jaceford/), who always kills it each week on the musical front. These people are like ninjas at their crafts, so it's cool that I know ninjas, I think. 

And now for some news...

The season 2 finale (Episode 25) will also be the finale of the show itself. Next week will mark the end of Web Zeroes. We've known that's how it was going to be for a month or so now, but couldn't really talk about it until the release of this episode. I wish we could have told you guys sooner, but that's just the way the cookie crumbles. I think it's important to note that ending the show is our decision, mostly because it has just been too exhausting to do the show as a part time job in addition to our day jobs. We're thankful to Revision3 for the opportunity to broadcast this show to a much bigger audience than we had before, and for allowing us the privilege of being their first scripted series.

What does this mean for the future of Smooth Few Films? Well, we're not entirely sure. We need a few months off to sort things out, take some rest and then go from there. I'll be talking about that more in a future post, but I'll go ahead and say that it does not mean the return of Leet World. In fact, this experience has convinced us more than ever that we have to go about things differently in the future. But as I said, we'll be talking about that more later.

For now, enjoy the episode, because I think it's a good one. And if you live in Texas, you should go read up about our [Web Zeroes Wrap Party](http://www.facebook.com/event.php?eid=135223289836476), and come hang out with us. 



Watch, spread the word, and enjoy, dudes. Also, thanks for watching. We really appreciate it.
