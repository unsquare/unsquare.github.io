![mic-audio](http://smoothfewfilms.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/mic-audio.jpg)This was my first semi-free weekend in ages. And what did I do? I spent some time putting together outtakes from Season 2 of TLW, Episodes 7 and 8. The lengths I go for you people!

It was interesting going back through these old audio files. One thing that we've never really done in outtakes is include bits where cast members have dropped spoilers as a joke. Now that the show is over, those boundaries are gone, so there are one or two of those sprinkled about. I'm also particularly fond of the Asher outtakes here, as well as Ben's constant surprise when he reads jokes for the first time. He became a tad fixated on the idea of Cortez's extra balls, but aren't we all?

So, listen and partake in a couple of _lulz_. I know I did. Right click and save as to download. And as things typically go with goofing around, the language is more than likely NSFW.

In other news, Episode 4 of Web Zeroes is out on Wednesday. Probably my favorite episode so far.
