We're hard at work on some great new content- a short, an episode, and various extras- but none of those endeavors are at the point where we can show anything off, really.  So instead, I bring more pictures from our weekend of work.  A couple are from Episode Ten, and a couple are from our new Halo short.

Speaking of Halo, I forgot just how pretty the 720p capture was until we started doing it again tonight.  I love the way it looks.

I think you'll find one of the Episode Ten shots particularly interesting...
