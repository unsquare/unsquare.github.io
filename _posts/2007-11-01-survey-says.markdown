Some news...

Episode Six trailer: coming soon.  And I would underline soon, but I don't feel like it.

We're doing another podcast, shortly after the release of the sixth episode.  There's a topic [going on in our forums](http://www.smoothfewfilms.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=5&t=269), but I thought I would post it here, too- if you have something you'd like us to discuss regarding the show, let us know.  We won't get to every topic, and for time's sake, we'll pick the most interesting ones, but we'd love to talk about what you guys want to hear about.

Also, in gaming this week:  [Daddy/daughter Bioshock routine](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEqZkglTVYE), [Luigi is unlockable in Mario Galaxies](http://kotaku.com/gaming/spoiler/hidden-playable-character-in-mario-galaxy-revealed-317469.php), [Metal Gear Solid 4 is delayed](http://ps3.ign.com/articles/831/831655p1.html), and [a kid punched his mom over Halo 3](http://www.joystiq.com/2007/11/01/halo-3-spawns-juvenile-mother-puncher/).
