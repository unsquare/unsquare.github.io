If a turret bitches about its job and nobody is around to hear it, does it make a sound?  You bet it does.  "[A Day in the Life of a Turret](http://www.smoothfewfilms.com/2008/01/18/portal-a-day-in-the-life-of-a-turret-2/)" catches two turrets on the job during a typical day at the Aperture Science Enrichment Center, and the monotony that lies within.  Enjoy!
