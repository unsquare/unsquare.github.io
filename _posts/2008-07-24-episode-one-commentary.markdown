Well dudes, here is the first installment of our Episode commentaries. Hopefully you'll find out a few things that you didn't know, or just laugh while listening to us goof around during the first episode of The Leet World.

Listening to the commentary works best if you have already downloaded the episode (that way you don't have to worry about buffering). Simply download the audio file below and play it in conjunction with the episode. Once the commentary starts, we give you a little countdown so you know when to start the episode on your end (hit play on "go"), that way you'll be in sync with what we're saying.

We tried a new recording method for this commentary as well and I have to say it worked out alright, though a certain someone had the mic a tad too close to his mouth. We still love Daniel, though.

Enjoy! Right-click and select "save as" to download it.
