We promised it when we released Episode 10, so here it is: the premier of Leeroy's short film, "Conform".

[Sarcasm]Â  It is a heartfelt drama about... well, really, you'll just have to watch it for yourselves.  Leeroy's  a deep thinker, you see, and that kind of stuff just goes over my head.

Other quotes about the movie:

"NeEDS MOAR SeTS!11!"- Player

"A digimal triumph."- Ellis

"I don't know what the f--- this movie is about."- Chet

Try to enjoy.  You won't be able to if you're not artsy enough.  At least, that's what Leeroy told us.[/Sarcasm]  Also, expect some more extras by the end of the week.

FYI- This movie is a joke.  It's supposed to be bad.
