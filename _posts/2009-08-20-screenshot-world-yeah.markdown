Thanks for all of the congratulatory posts regarding our news from last week. I really wish I could tell you guys some more, but unfortunately, that cat has to remain in the bag for just a little while longer. All I can say is that this new project is already starting to eat up all of our time, and will continue to do so for months to come. Funny enough, we are managing to put one time sucker to rest in exchange for a shinier one.

It is impacting the series finale (and already affected Episode 13) in a few ways, mainly in that it's taking longer to make. We're getting pretty close to being done filming it completely, and as I said before, I'll let you guys know when we're about a week away from release. 

In the meantime, check out some new screenshots. They contain images of machinima ownage and dudes shooting at other dudes.

Also, has anyone seen District 9? I'm planning on going this weekend and I keep hearing great things. I have a condition where I ache to see awesome sci-fi action, and the movie appears to be able to scratch my _itch_ in a meaningful way.
