![How about a nice game of chess?](http://www.smoothfewfilms.com/images/defcon1.jpg)

Wow.  What a crazy weekend.

As you are no doubt keenly aware, our server got- well- served.  Thoroughly. ["A Day in the Life of a Turret"](http://www.smoothfewfilms.com/2008/01/18/portal-a-day-in-the-life-of-a-turret-2/) has been a huge success, to say the least.Â  I guess people like them some Portal videos.

Much thanks to [Digg](http://www.digg.com), [Kotaku](http://www.kotaku.com), [Joystiq](http://www.joystiq.com), [Destructoid](http://www.destructoid.com), [1Up](http://www.1up.com), [Next-Gen](http://www.next-gen.biz/), [XBox 360 Fanboy](http://www.xbox360fanboy.com), and all the others that pushed massive traffic (read: tens of thousands) to our humble abode, whose walls could not withstand the battering ram of the insatiable, tentacle-ey interweb.

Now that things have slowed down, we are re-hosting what will be forever known around Smooth Few Films as _the video. _There are a few places to find it.

[Click here to see the download links](http://www.smoothfewfilms.com/2008/01/18/portal-a-day-in-the-life-of-a-turret-2/). An Ipod version will appear soon.

[GamingTV](http://www.gamingtv.us) has kindly hosted some mirrors for us.  [GamingTV Mirrors!](http://gamingtv.us/home/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=601&Itemid=1)

Expect the [Damn Dangerous](http://www.myspace.com/damndangerous) song to appear on our site tomorrow!

As promised, here are the first screenshots from Episode Nine of The Leet World.  Obviously, we're not going to give much away, though there is a small revelation about the setting.  Enjoy!
