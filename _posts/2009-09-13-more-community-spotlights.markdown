![batman-spotlight](http://smoothfewfilms.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/batman-spotlight.jpg)One thing that we love doing is watching things that dudes from the community have made concerning our ridiculous library of Smooth Few Films work. It's baffling to us that people like what we do enough to spend their own free time making a tribute to it. 

Before, we've posted some [community favorites](http://smoothfewfilms.com/2009/01/12/the-leet-world-fan-works/#more-1351) of ours, so I thought I'd repeat that again with some new links that we found recently. 

Check these out:



	
  * [Day in the Life of a Turret piano cover](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YK5_Awy-mZY). Though sometimes YouTube can be a pit of despair, there are plenty of dudes that make it worth it to be there, such as [David Debono](http://www.youtube.com/user/daviddebonomalta), who has an awesome video of him playing [Nine to Five](http://smoothfewfilms.com/2008/01/21/nine-to-five/), the song from our Portal video. We were hanging out last week during our shoot when Jace found this video and promptly freaked out, he was so excited.

	
  * [TLW Season 2 trailer](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRqUvEg9MAo). A pretty impressively put-together trailer for our 2nd season. While it's not heavy on effects and such, the guy just did a great job of researching through the season and finding some great lines. The clips are organized really well and the trailer kind of pumped me up a little for the finale, even though I know how it ends.

	
  * [TLW Typography](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BB5gqV9RyPM). This one needs almost no explanation. It kind of made me a _lulz bandit_.



So yeah, view those guys for some awesome tributes. We have some hearts for them. And if you have anymore things that you want to draw our attention to, send them over. 

Oh, and if you're wanting a TLW Finale update, our target is still this upcoming week. Probably later rather than sooner. Also, everyone dies. Not really. But maybe.
