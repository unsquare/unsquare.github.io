So while Daniel and Nick have been gone, I've unleashed a slew of content in your general vicinity. Hopefully it's been somewhat entertaining and in some cases, informative. Since you've all been kind of asking and secretly wishing, today I bring you Episode Four and Five audio outtakes. I trust that you'll find them amusing.

Daniel and Nick have now returned back from Cali, so Episode Six can finally continue on its merry. Expect a trailer soon.

Enjoy, and please donate.
