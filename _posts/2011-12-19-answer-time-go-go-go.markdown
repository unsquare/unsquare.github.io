[![CS: GO](http://smoothfewfilms.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/cs-go.jpg)](http://smoothfewfilms.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/cs-go.jpg)

Man, I'm terrible. I've waited since August to answer some of your questions. Hopefully you don't all hate me for that, but I think I've given you plenty of other reasons to loathe me before this oversight.

Because it's Christmas and I'm feeling charitable, I figured it was finally time to give you guys a few answers. As I said last time, feel free to leave more questions in the comments, especially if I didn't get to your question this time.

And now, Q's plus A's:

_1) What all have you been up to since the hiatus?_

[GamerSushi](http://gamersushi.com/)! Nick, Jeff and I help run the video game blog and even recorded a few podcasts. We've been on a bit of a break from that (for reasons I'm about to list below), but they're a good time and worth a listen. We've got a video podcast going up soon if Nick can ever pull himself from his beard long enough to do things.

In terms of other stuff going on, Daniel and Nick have both been out in Los Angeles, working for the man and making some money with various productions. They are currently working on a pilot for Dan Harmon's [Channel 101](http://channel101.com/), an original piece they crafted with Jace called Street Justice. I've seen the script and I think it's going to be awesome. As soon as it's online, I'll direct you guys over to it. Daniel's also been updating a design blog, [Done Well Is So Much Better](http://www.donewellissomuchbetter.com/), at times. It's neat.

As for me, I've been working on the second draft of my novel. I've also taken a freelance writing gig with Rooster Teeth to help on Season 10 of Red Vs Blue. It's kind of cool. I wrote a tad more about it on [my blog](http://eddyrivas.com/2011/12/17/some-end-of-year-updates/), if you're interested.

_2) Do you guys miss working on content for Smooth Few Films?_

Yes and no. I don't think any of us miss the exercise in tedium that was Leet World, or the ridiculous daily grind that made up Web Zeroes. Much less doing all that work for no pay. The experience taught us a lot about ourselves and about what we like to do, but we're not itching to go back to that formula of lots of work and no lives for no compensation.

That being said, we do get that itch and miss out on the fun part of storytelling. There's nothing quite like writing or producing something and knowing that thousands of people are going to see what you're working on, and soon. Everything else since then has felt like working in a vacuum. So yeah, we get nostalgic about the platform that we had to show people our stuff. But that's about it.

_3) Will you guys make anything in Counter-Strike: GO?_

This is a tricky one. I don't want to say never, but I don't want to make any promises I can't keep either. As of right now, I'm not in love with the character models of CS: GO, and I'm not sure it would translate all that well for a fun little updated TLW short.

In addition, I'm not even sure what kind of machinima opportunities would even be available with the updated engine. It's one of those things where I'd have to play it for awhile and see if there was anything we could do. And on top of that, we'd all have to want to do it.

I think my big worry would be releasing a one-off short, and then having people go nuts and demanding more. That's a good problem to have, to be sure. But it's still an issue to consider.

_4) I was thinking of using Roxio Game Capture for the PC to capture footage, do you think this piece of hardware is a good buy? Or should I use an actual capture card?_

I'm not the expert here (that would be Daniel and Nick), but I'd recommend a dedicated capture card when you can, if your concern is maintaining the quality of the original. I'm guessing going through a box like that is adding a stop for the footage, which just gives it another spot to lose quality. Also, I haven't read great reviews of that particular piece of Roxio hardware. If nothing else, and you decide that you don't want to invest the kind of money in a dedicated card, I'd always recommend hardware over software.

_5) Can I make TLW DVDs for my own personal use?_

Go for it. The reason we never made them is because we can't sell them. Download the episodes and go nuts! You can't sell them either, by the way. So don't do that.
