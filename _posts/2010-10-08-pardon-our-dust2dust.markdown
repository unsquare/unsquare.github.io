I now bring to you guys the third track of the illustrious TLW soundtrack penned by sir Jace Ford, Dust2Dust. Many of you will remember that we released this tune under the name of [Ambush at Bombsite B](http://smoothfewfilms.com/2008/03/13/ambushed/) when Episode 4 of TLW first aired. Since then, Jace has done a little bit more to it, and I actually love the re-release more than the original, and that's saying a lot.

Listen. Enjoy. Feel epic.

Right click and save as to save that to your demon machines.

I saw a pretty cool [review of Web Zeroes](http://idlecycles.blogspot.com/2010/08/viewing-cycles-webzeroes.html) the other day, and I thought I would pass it along. Definitely nice when people recognize the hard work that went into the show, and the spirit of its geekitude, something we really strove for during its production.

And continuing on that cool stuff vibe, I've got a couple of more links for you guys. One, for all of you old school PC gamers out there, we got a retro feature up on GamerSushi the other day about [how to make a Myst movie that doesn't suck](http://gamersushi.com/2010/10/07/dear-hollywood-5-tips-to-prevent-a-lame-myst-movie/). Two, I've done a piece on my blog about my ridiculous fan nerd love of [Final Fantasy 7](http://eddyrivas.com/2010/10/06/what-a-game-can-do-final-fantasy-7/) and how it changed me as a gamer.

Attack those at your leisure.
