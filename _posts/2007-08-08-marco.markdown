If you're here for the first episode, scroll down just a tad, or go check it out at [the episodes page](http://www.smoothfewfilms.com/episodes/). Just a quick update that the high definition download is up and running, and the 640 x 360 quicktime has been updated so that it looks a little smoother.  It seems that most people are downloading either the flash or the smaller quicktime one anyway, so it's all good, though we'd recommend checking out the 1280 x 720 version, as that's how the show was originally filmed.  Seriously, I didn't realize Source could look so good once we got filming.

Also, it would be way sweet if you went and voted for us on both [spikedhumor.com](http://www.spikedhumor.com/articles/119519/The_Leet_World_Episode_1_Reality_Bites.html) and [metacafe.com](http://www.metacafe.com/watch/755096/the_leet_world_episode_one_reality_bites/).   We should be up on [machinima.com](http://www.machinima.com) at some point, as well as [gwchannel.tv](http://gwchannel.tv) (which is a very awesome CS video website).

Keep spreading the word, and if you check back here in the next couple of days, there could be a fun treat waiting (no, not episode 2, we are merely men).  Episode 2 is being worked on, and should hopefully be up in about 2-3 weeks.  Don't quote me on that, though.  For reals.  I'll sue.
