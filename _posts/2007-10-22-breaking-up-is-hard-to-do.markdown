But I'm sure the Terrorists will get by.  I know you're all probably curious about the way Episode Five ended, and we're all glad to hear it.  Ahmad's stunt was I'm sure totally unexpected, and that's just the way we like it.

Episode Six is already being filmed, though you'll be sad to hear that some slight delays are in the forecast.  The reason?  Daniel and Nick are heading out to California to visit our music maestro, Damn Dangerous (or Jace, as he's known on his home planet).  What will Eddy do for the six days they are gone?  Write Episode Seven, of course.  But I'll also be releasing some fun (depending on your point of view) content for you guys.

There was about a minute and a half or so deleted from Episode Five that I'm sure you guys will be interested to see, though it's not super interesting per se, which is why it was cut in the first place.  Also, there might be a little surprise for you guys while they are gone, too.

All that to say that Episode Six might have short delays (nothing crazy like Episode Four) just because of the nature of the next few weeks.  October is hell month for me at work, plus Nick and Daniel traveling= The Leet World doesn't get all that fun attention.  But like I said, no worries, there will be lots of content for everyone, and once Nick and Daniel return, we'll be back on our normal schedule again.

In the meantime, here are some screenshots from Episode Six:
