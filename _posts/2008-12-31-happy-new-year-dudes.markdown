![hny1](http://smoothfewfilms.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/hny1.jpg)Just wanted to wish you guys a Happy New Year to ring in 2009. Hopefully this one will bring many more laughs, twists, surprises, and great storylines for all of your favorite characters. We've got lots of great stuff in store for both TLW and WZ, and when we get around to it, G.R.I.E.F.

Thanks for sticking around to watch our ridiculous videos, and for encouraging us to do more. You guys are pretty cool.

Play some games, rock out like Chet, and party like animals. Stay away from Nick, though. He is dangerous when full of the alcohol. A veritable yeti/mountain man, full of trickery and/or hijinks. Those are dangerous things brewing together.

Anywho, happy new year, dudes. Play some Counter-Strike or go kill some zombies or something.
