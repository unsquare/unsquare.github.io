**Det. Dawson, [Case File No. 14113](../2008/07/31/the-case-of-adam-sizlewski/)**

Back to Square One. I might have to go off the books for the next few weeks. Something doesn't add up here. Finally logged Exhibit B, but it seems rather inconsequential to me. Traced the call back to a warehouse in Italy but all that was left there was dust and echoes.

[Exhibit B (Sizlewski's answering machine)](http://www.smoothfewfilms.com/extras/ExhibitB.mp3)

Probably just some kids screwing around, or some bored workers.
