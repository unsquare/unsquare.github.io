Episode 9 and 10 Outtakes, anyone? They've arrived. I'm excited, because 1) I'm a fan of extras, and 2) it's been awhile since we've been able to post outtakes. The funny thing is, we would do it every episode, but we've gotten fairly efficient at getting in the sound booth (my closet) and getting our stuff done. Occasionally, we start goofing around or forget that we're being recorded, and that's when you get these comic gems.

Episode 11 is currently being filmed. Some of the first screenshots will be up this weekend.
