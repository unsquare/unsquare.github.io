![storm](http://smoothfewfilms.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/storm.jpg)We now present to you dudes Season 2, Episode 7 of The Leet World, [Tempest](http://smoothfewfilms.com/2009/03/28/tempest/). As we've said for several weeks, this episode is a game changer, in more ways than one. 

It also officially marks the halfway point of Season 2, in terms of the story we're telling. Does that mean the whole season is going to be 14 episodes? Maybe, maybe not. We'll see how it unfolds. 

But just like Episode 8 was a big mile marker last season, this episode is serving the same function. And just like last year, we're taking a few weeks off to get ready for the back half of this epic season. We need it!

Remember, you can watch a higher res version at the [TLW premiere page](http://www.smoothfewfilms.com/premiere/), or just watch it after the jump!

Do be careful about spoilers if you decide to read the comments before watching the video. Super big thanks to Damn Dangerous for yet another rocking score. Some of the moments in this episode gave me chills, for real.

Enjoy!
