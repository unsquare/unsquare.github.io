[![bruce-willis](http://smoothfewfilms.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/05/bruce-willis.jpg)](http://smoothfewfilms.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/05/bruce-willis.jpg)If you [follow us on twitter](http://www.twitter.com/smoothfewfilms/), then you'd know that Episode 10 is shaping up to be a beast of a different sort. Imagine a hulking brute that spits acid and isn't intimidated by Nick's beard and then you know what you're dealing with. It is unruly and grotesque. In a good way.

Anywho, part of the reason for this is that it has quite a humongous action sequence in it, and before I get carried away with superlatives, I will just say that it might own you. We're big fans of action films (if you can't tell), so this is always a treat for us. By the way, the picture is from Die Hard, so if you haven't seen it, I might ban you. Welcome to the party, pal.

Here are some screenshots from Episode 10. I had to work very hard to find ones that don't give anything away. There's just way too much to spoil.

Hope you enjoy the tease.
