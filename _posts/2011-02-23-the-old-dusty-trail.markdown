Gentlemen, we had a good run. Smooth Few Films is on indefinite hiatus. 

This update has been a couple of months in the making, and I apologize for not doing it sooner. To be honest, I didn't really know how to say it, and I was kind of heartsick about even writing it. I've also been busy with a lot of stuff in my personal life from work to writing a novel and I avoided it because I knew it would pain me to write it. But now that comments have come over to my personal blog queue about this site I felt like it was time to do something. So again, I apologize to those of you who have checked back here every day hoping for an update. I know there are quite a few of you (thanks to the wonder of Google Analytics) and it for real means the world that there's that kind of dedication to our bumbling Internet troupe. 

The reasons for the indefinite hiatus are fairly easy to explain. For one, Daniel moved to L.A. a month or two back in order to follow his dreams as a film dude. Him and Jace are living together and doing awesome things. I fully expect them to hit some big successes out there, and will probably update this blog to let you guys know about them whenever they happen. Daniel was always the talented one, so him leaving was what really solidified the decision for us. 

Beyond that, we really did burn ourselves out from 2 plus years of throwing everything we had at Smooth Few Films. It may not have looked like much, but we gave up the majority of our free time, thousands of dollars and sacrificed a few opportunities and friendships along the way. We did all of that because we loved telling stories, and tried to do our best to tell a couple of fun ones. 

Truth be told, the most fun part of the whole thing for me was seeing the way you guys, our community, really latched on to what we were doing and how you reacted to it each and every step of the way. I seriously go back through comments of old Leet World episodes sometimes, just to relive the excitement you all had for the stuff we made. I can't speak for the other guys, but for me, that totally made it worth all of the time we toiled.

Is this the end of us working together? Not by any means. As I've maintained (and why I put this post off), we've got lots of things we want to do... eventually. What the magical conditions are and what stars have to align for that to happen is anyone's guess. When/if the indefinite status changes, you guys will be the first to know. Believe me, I'm rooting for it.

Without being cheesy, all I can say is that I love you dudes and I've always appreciated the love you've thrown back our way, when we really didn't deserve it. You guys are awesome.

-Eddy, signing off.
