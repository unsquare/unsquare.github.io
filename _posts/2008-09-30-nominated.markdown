![](http://smoothfewfilms.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/09/nominated.gif)Sorry for the lack of updates, but I've been without Internet for a few days here.

However, I return with some good news. A few weeks ago, we submitted our videos to the [Machinima Festival](http://festival.machinima.org/) that happens in Novemeber. Well, the results are in: Smooth Few Films has been nominated for several machinima awards!

Here's the breakdown:



	
  * **Day in the Life of a Turret**- _Best Short Format/ Best Music_



	
  * **The Bag Boy**- _Best Short Format/ Best Voice Acting/ Best Writing_



	
  * **The Leet World**- _Honorary Mention, Best Series_


I won't pretend that we're not disappointed that The Leet World didn't get an actual nomination for Best Series, seeing as how hard we've worked on it, or that it wasn't recognized for the incredible music that Jace has continually produced for us. Personally, I still can't think of another series save for Red Vs Blue that devotes as much as we do to characters and story, but to each his own.

All that said, though, we're excited to be nominated for what we did get nominated for, and hopefully we can take home some kind of award come November, when the winners are announced.

In other news, production is starting on The Leet World, Season 2, and we filmed the next episode of Web Zeroes over the weekend. Stick around, because more things are coming this week, including commentary for Episode 3 of TLW!
