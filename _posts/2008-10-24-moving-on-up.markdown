Last night, we filmed the first scene of Season 2 of The Leet World. Pretty wild. Of course, we would have gotten more done, except we were having all kinds of technical issues with the capture card and with the camera computer. But hey, I guess that means it's business as normal, eh? Wouldn't be TLW if there wasn't a bunch of complications. Now that the dust is all cleared out, we should be off to the machinimaking races.

I can't wait to show you guys some proper screenshots, and you should start getting some of those next week, once we have some things we can really display. For now though, I have brought some teasers...

Looks like somebody's got a bit of an upgrade...

Have fun with that. Also, I just put up an article at GamerSushi titled ["Are we Really Ready for the Next Gen?"](http://gamersushi.com/2008/10/24/are-we-really-ready-for-next-gen/). You guys should check it out, and I would appreciate it if you could [Digg it](http://digg.com/gaming_news/Are_We_Really_Ready_For_Next_Gen), too, for those of you who enjoy it. I'd heart you forever. Or at least for today.
