As was indicated at the end of the last episode, the storm is gathering for the folks at The Leet World house. We now present to you dudes Episode 6, [Thunderhead](http://smoothfewfilms.com/2009/03/12/thunderhead/), for your viewing enjoyment. In this episode, we see the second challenge, which has a slightly different feel than any of the other challenge episodes have had up to this point.

I'm really thinking you guys are going to dig this episode and the next one, which will be out by the end of March. Some cool stuff is going down, and I think you'll like where it's all pointing. Remember, you can check out a higher resolution version on the [TLW premiere page](http://smoothfewfilms.com/premiere/).

Or, just check the episode out after the jump!

Enjoy!
