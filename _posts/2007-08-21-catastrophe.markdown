Well, not entirely.  Unfortunately, we ran into some snags when trying to finish out the remainder of episode two, so don't expect it until tomorrow (Wednesday).  The funny thing about editing something like this is that the last 5 percent of it (tweaking audio levels, making the cuts tighter, throwing in transitions and music between scenes, chopping up dialogue, etc) takes just as long to finish or longer than the first 95 percent.  Believe me, no one's more bummed about the delay than we are, but the episode should be all the better for it.

Also, I'll take this opportunity to tell you that the site will be more content-heavy between the release of episodes two and three.  There will definitely be some fun stuff for you guys to check out (maybe even a video) while you guys wait.
