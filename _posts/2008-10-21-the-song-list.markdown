Thought I'd give you guys the official song list of The Leet World soundtrack, which should be out within a week.



	
  * The Leet World Theme Jam (heard at the end of the Season Finale)

	
  * The Producer

	
  * Dust 2 Dust (formerly Ambush at Bombsite B... it's undergone some revisions)

	
  * Domination Man Cometh (a fully fleshed out version of the Domination Man's theme)

	
  * If It Bleeds (heard during the hunt for the Domination Man in Episode 8 )

	
  * Wrong Side of the Hax (the main battle music)

	
  * Attack of the Noob (Ahmad vs. Cortez, given the video game dungeon orchestral makeover)

	
  * Ocho Muertos (the rocking beat heard at the end of Episode 13)

	
  * Challenge Activated

	
  * End of All Things

	
  * Bonus Tracks: TLW Theme, TLW Podcast Theme, TLW Ninja Theme (Jace's mysterious entry into the Themetacular contest)


While we're not ready to give the full price just yet, we will say that buying the album all at once comes in at under $10. Songs will also be available individually, and in bundles of 3 as well.

Edit: My bad. In case I wasn't clear, this will be only available through download initially, here at the site. PayPal will be the primary means of purchasing. Hope that clears things up!
