So in two weeks, Daniel and I will be flying out to Seattle to partake in PAX. For those of you don't know, PAX is the Penny Arcade Expo and it is a glorious celebration in gaming and gamers. There will be a number of awesome things to do, including seeing Rooster Teeth, Jonathan Coulton, a bevy of unreleased games and hours of other fine entertainments. To check out the full line up of the nerdery, [click here](http://www.pennyarcadeexpo.com/PAX_2008_Schedule.pdf). Looks wild.

Anywho, we're busy fist-pumping about that, and excited to get out there and say hey to some folks. Other things we're excited about include Web Zeroes, which is now getting closer to completion. In addition, we're nearing the launch of our new site(s) as well as the trailer for GRIEF, part of which was filmed tonight.

Much thanks to all you dudes who participated. Some screenies:
