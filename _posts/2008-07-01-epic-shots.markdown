We cliffhang like [Sly Stallone](http://youtube.com/watch?v=URdSD8UWxLk).

Now that the hubbub over the end of Part 2 has died out long enough for me to speak, I wanted to give you dudes a few screenshots from Part 3 of the Season Finale. Unfortunately, I can't tell you when it's going to be out, because it's all taking a tad longer than we anticipated. Rest assured that Nick and I are devoting virtually all of our free time to knocking this finale out of the park. I'll let you know more soon, along with an announcement or two.

Also, if you have a few moments, I have some lines in the new episode of [Red Vs Blue](http://rvb.roosterteeth.com/archive/episode.php?id=290). You can hear my dulcet tones in the first scene and elsewhere. Woot and such.
