We've got a winner to the Themetacular Contest, and his name is DJ Shox. Wow. I didn't expect such a turn-around, but apparently, Shox has been hitting the campaign trail. Like. A. Madman. His rendition of the theme song will now land a coveted spot in the Season Finale intro sequence.

Congrats, dude, you earned it. To hear more of DJ Shox's compositions, feel free to [listen at your heart's content](http://www.soundclick.com/bands/default.cfm?bandID=94352).

To everyone else who entered, much thanks for participating, we really loved hearing all that you guys put out there for us to enjoy. It was such a great thing to see this community jumping into something like this. Not everyone's favorite won, but hey, that's why we vote.

Me thinks we need more contests in the future. If you somehow missed all of the excitement, you can go [listen to the finalists](http://www.smoothfewfilms.com/2008/05/26/themetacular-voting-begins/). But for now, here's your Miss America:
