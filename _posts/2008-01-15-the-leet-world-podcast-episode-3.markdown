As promised, the first bit of content is here for your enjoyment, The Leet World Podcast, Episode 3. We answered a few of the questions that people asked on the forums in this podcast, and cover a wide array of topics including: Episode 8, the Domination character, CSS vs Gmod, The Over-Achiever, my addiction to gamer points, creative differences (disagreements), and Daniel's dislike of dark places. For the most part, it is nothing but TLW content.

All of this clocks in at a fairly reasonable time of under 20 minutes. Give it a listen:

Keep in mind that any "spoilers" or "hints" that we may give about upcoming episodes in the future of The Leet World series are just jokes... or are they?

Check out [this thread in the forums](http://www.smoothfewfilms.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=5&t=439) to find out more about the questions that we either didn't have the time to answer, or that we did answer but had to edit for time's sake.
