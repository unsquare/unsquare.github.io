The soundtrack will be hitting any day now, and very suddenly when it does. To be honest, we're not even sure exactly when it'll drop, but as soon as we pass that magical "completed" barrier, we'll know.

If you're planning on buying the album (or just a few songs), there is something you can do to get ready- make sure you have a [PayPal account](https://www.paypal.com/). That makes the process super fast, but if not, once you go through the order process, there will be a way to pay for it with just a credit card.

I know people will have lots of suggestions about ways that you would like us to sell it, which is all fine and dandy. However, before we explore other avenues of release (iTunes, CDBaby, etc), we need to make sure that we've got one method that _works_ and works well, so that we can better serve you dudes in the future. There will be other ways to buy the album eventually, as soon as they're ready.

In other news, filming commenced last night on Season 2, as well as the technical issues we were having. However, the culprit has been found (my noobishness), and we should be back on track when we keep filming tomorrow. Pretty weird being back in the saddle. My butt is not quite as calloused to TLW's ferocious ways, but soon, soon that mare will be tamed.

EDIT: By the way, the album is priced at $8.50, if you buy the whole thing in full all at once. That nets you 10 songs plus 3 bonus tracks. If you buy each song individually, you'll spend $1 each.
