Smooth Few Films wishes all of you dudes and dudettes a Merry Christmas, happy holidays, etc.  From the bottom of our hearts, you have made the latter half of 2007 a year to remember.

I'd like to remind you all that Santa could be leaving a pretty special present here in the next couple of days.  I hear it's so cool he couldn't even get it here by Christmas.  So be sure and check the website, which for the purpose of this metaphor shall be a Christmas tree.  And no, the present is not a subtitled version of Episode Eight (though you should expect that at some point soon as well).  It's niftier than that.

Also, drop by the forums and [weigh in on your loot](http://www.smoothfewfilms.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=26&t=376)!
