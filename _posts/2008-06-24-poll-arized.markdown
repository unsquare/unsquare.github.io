Thanks for the birthday wishes. We're all growns up, eh?

A couple of updates. First, the Season Finale: Part Two will be up later this week. Missing a team member is slowing down overall production, though Nick and I have achieved some kind of apotheosis of creativity, working at previously unseen levels of efficiency, whirlwinds of pure ass-kickery. Yes, there has been kicking and/or chopping as we work the episode kung-fu.

Much thanks to [Mystfit](http://www.youtube.com/mystfit) for helping us with some model issues that will make completing the filming of Part Three much simpler. Also, while you're in the mood for some good machinima, check out [Young Street Productions](http://youtube.com/user/YngStreetProductions), some new guys that have made what I find to be some pretty funny and clever stuff. Subscribe to both of those dudes. You won't regret it.

Lastly, I present to you a poll. Voice your thoughts.Â By the way, I suppose I need to add that this doesn't affect the show in any way - the ending is set in stone already. I'm just curious to see what people think is going down.

**This poll is now closed.**
