It's finally here. The Season Finale of The Leet World, "[Death Comes Home](http://www.smoothfewfilms.com/2008/06/17/death-comes-home/)", Part One, is now available. Parts Two and Three will be coming over the next two weeks.

This is a proud moment for Smooth Few Films, as not that many machinimakers have completed a lengthy season of a series like this. Once again, thanks for hanging in there and being so supportive. Part One gets the ball rolling for what will hopefully be an exciting conclusion to the first season.

Downloadable versions will be available later. [Click here to Digg this episode](http://digg.com/pc_games/The_Leet_World_Episode_14_Death_Comes_Home_Season_Finale).
