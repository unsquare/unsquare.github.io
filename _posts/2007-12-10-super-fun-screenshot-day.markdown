Here are some more screenshots from Episode Eight.  The more we film it the more we're realizing just how gigantic this episode is.  Fun stuff.

Also, a couple of small peeks at our Halo 3 short.  Last night was our first time filming in the Halo 3 engine, and it's fairly interesting to try and apply our methods in another "location".  Some of the stuff that works in TLW didn't work here, and in some ways it's easier.  We're pretty happy with how it looks, though.  Capturing at 720p is hot.

More on that project soon, but not today.  Just screenies today.  Enjoy!
