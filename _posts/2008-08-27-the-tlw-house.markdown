Thanks for the cool response that you guys gave to the [G.R.I.E.F. trailer](http://www.smoothfewfilms.com/2008/08/24/grief-trailer/). I've got to say, the general excitement people showed for it was pretty sweet. We're looking forward to doing a few episodes of G.R.I.E.F. while we continue to recharge and prepare for Season 2 of The Leet World.

The Web Zeroes Pilot should be hitting at some point next week, as well as some other cool TLW extras. Also, PAX is this weekend, and I really can't wait, but more on that later.

It occurred to me that some of you dudes would be stoked to have a couple of the maps that we film on. Nothing too exciting, just thought you'd like to have them. So, here you go- simply download these and then stick them into your cstrike/maps folder:

[TLW House](http://www.smoothfewfilms.com/extras/maps/cs_militiatlwtable.bsp)
[Death Room](http://www.smoothfewfilms.com/extras/maps/whiteroom.bsp)

Edit: For those of you wondering, the TLW House is an edited Militia map with no hosties, no time limit, no cars in the garage and Leeroy's Lair. Also, that map probably won't work in GMod if you don't have CSS, but the Death Room should be just fine.
