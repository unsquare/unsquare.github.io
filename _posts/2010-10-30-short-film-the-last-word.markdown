I think I end up saying this all the time these days, but sorry to you faithful dudes about the lack of updates around here. As I said before, there's just not a whole lot to update on at the moment. Everyone's kind of doing their own thing, and whether that turns into a Smooth Few Films project in the near future is anyone's guess. 

For instance, I've been working on a monster of a book which I just finished in this past week. It's a huge unwieldy fantasy story that needs a ton of editing that I can't wait to get started on. Meanwhile, Daniel recently produced a short film with his bud [Ryan Hargrave](http://twitter.com/ryanhargrave) for a local art show. It's called The Last Word, and I kind of love it. Different from the tone that you guys are used to from Daniel's work to be sure, but that's not a bad thing.



You'll notice a few SFF regulars in there, including Alex, who played Pedro in WZ and also ran sound for that series as well. You'll also see Ty, the lovable Bobby King. Music by Jace Ford, in what I think is one of his best pieces yet. Plus, Daniel plays a dude that chases people and beats them up. Anyway, take a gander to see what I mean, and give Daniel his props. 

Another TLW soundtrack song coming next week!
