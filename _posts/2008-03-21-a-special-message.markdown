There's quite a bit of you guys out there floating in the nebulous ether of the internet. You know who you are: The Leet World fans. Some of you are on this site, some of you are out on YouTube and some of you get updates from other websites. While we love the long, sweeping arms of "da web", ultimately, we'd like to see all of our fan community located in one place. That's why we try to offer things like podcasts, screenshots, forums, trailers, and extras to make sure you guys come here first for information regarding future episodes and projects.

While more and more people are coming from these other places, we'd still like to see our website become more of a central hub for the people that like our videos. So often on YouTube we get messages like "When's the next episode" or other questions that are answered right here on this site. This little message is up for our YouTube subscribers, encouraging them to come here for information regarding episodes and the like. I thought we'd show you guys, too.
