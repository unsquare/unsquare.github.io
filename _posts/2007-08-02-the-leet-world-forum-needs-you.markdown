As we've been saying, the release of our site and first episode approaches, and as such, we are attempting to to put together something of a community for the people that stumble into our path.  For those of you who are checking up on the process of the show, feel free to head on over to [The Leet World Forum](http://www.smoothfewfilms.com/forum), and help us test everything as we get ready.  Register, start some topics, interact with us, and that way we'll have the board somewhat populated in anticipation of the release.

Also, stay tuned, since tomorrow we'll be announcing the date that our first episode launches.
