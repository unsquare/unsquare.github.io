Just a quick update: PAX is incredible. Yesterday was practically a sensory overload in terms of going places and seeing all kinds of crazy stuff. We said hello to people from Bungie, Mega 64, Felicia Day, RoosterTeeth, and we also saw a ton of unreleased games like Dead Space, Fallout 3, etc. I'll write a bigger post with pictures about it soon enough, but it was just a very cool day overall for us in terms of handing out DVD's and business cards and trying to get our name out there.

If you're interested in reading more at the moment in terms of actual games, I've put a couple of things up on [GamerSushi](http://www.gamersushi.com), including a blurb about the coolest thing we saw all day in a clip of an animated Red Vs Blue series. I've also put up a video of MK vs DC (Batman vs the Joker!), and there are more videos coming over the next few hours.
