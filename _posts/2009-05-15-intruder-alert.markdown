We now present Episode 9 of Season 2, [Stranger in the House](http://smoothfewfilms.com/2009/05/15/stranger-in-the-house/), for your devouring. Eat and be merry, fools. With this, we approach the final lap, which, as I've said before, is more than a tad nuts. Hold on to your butts, Jurassic Park style. 

In this episode, Asher continues his mysterious agenda, and the two teams analyze themselves in the light of a new announcement from the Producer. Be sure to check out the [TLW premiere page](http://www.smoothfewfilms.com/premiere/) to see a bigger version of the episode. Clear your browser cache if you see the old video.

Or just check out the new episode after the jump!

Many props go to JJ for writing this episode (along with Ep 8 and the upcoming Ep 10). He's really had a difficult task with all the things that needed to be juggled for this arc, and I think the results are awesome. And just wait until you see the next one. Thanks, Jeff!

Be sure to thank Damn Dangerous too, for his melodious and awesome tunes, yet again. He pretty much spent the last couple of days scoring the episode. For real, his music makes this show what it is and I heart him muchly for it. 

Enjoy! Next episode in 2-3 weeks, due to the Memorial Day holiday weekend coming up.
