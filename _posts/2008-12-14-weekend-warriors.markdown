Been a busy weekend around these parts. Spent some time shooting the third episode of Web Zeroes, which was a good time. Also, Nick and I spent most of the shoot singing [Werewolf Bar Mitzvah](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bG65axXE-HY). By the way, 30 Rock is maybe the funniest show on TV.

Not only have we filmed the next episode of Web Zeroes, we're finishing out Episode 2 of Season 2 of The Leet World. I'm thinking you guys will enjoy this one, and it certainly feels more like a normal episode after the tumultuous ride in the premiere. Should be up in the next couple of days.

Be sure to watch the Spike Video Game Awards tonight. They've been lame in past years, but hopefully they'll be a little bit better tonight, along with some cool trailers for new games.

Oh, and [TheDuoGroup](http://www.theduogroup.com/blog/?p=751) has added a new short. Watch and enjoy the Halo 3 goodness.
