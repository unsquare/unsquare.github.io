Not the end.  Episode Ten.

I know you've all been waiting for an update, so here it is: Episode Ten is coming _very soon_.  Over the week, we've hit a few snags, so I don't want to say exactly when it'll be- just keep in mind that whenever that fabled release moment is, it's soon.

The Bag Boy is receiving some solid attention, which is nice.  Much thanks to [Destructoid.com](http://www.destructoid.com) for giving us some face time.  The idea for the video came about a few weeks ago.  We wondered what it would be like if two guys were in combat together and one of them teabagged a "corpse", as it were.  What kind of reaction would that elicit in real life?  I think the end result came out pretty well.

The last link is actually kind of incredible.
