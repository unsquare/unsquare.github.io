Smooth Few Films proudly presents: the final installment of Season One of The Leet World. Part 3 of the finale, [Death Comes Home](http://www.smoothfewfilms.com/2008/06/17/death-comes-home/).

It's been a wild ride. Thanks for sticking with us through our first season. We've learned a ton over the last year, and we hope to put it to good use in future episodes of The Leet World and beyond.



Also, stick around between seasons. There's more going on than I even listed in our [Announcements](http://www.smoothfewfilms.com/2008/07/07/announcing-new-things/). For instance, outtakes are coming next week and a 'making-of" feature is on its way in the near future. And who knows, maybe a special video or two to bridge the story between seasons... You won't regret staying around.

Read comments at your own risk- there are bound to be full of spoilers.
