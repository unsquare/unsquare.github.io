The holidays are almost over, and I am saddened that I will lose much gaming time. Been playing Prince of Persia, Fable II, The Force Unleashed, etc. But alas, the real world beckons yet again.

A bit ago, I mentioned the [Streamys](http://www.streamys.org/nominate.shtml), which are still accepting votes/nominations. Feel free to [submit Web Zeroes](http://www.streamys.org/nominate.shtml) for the comedic categories, if you feel inclined to do so. Also, Hawty McBloggy is running a contest called the "Best of Halo Awards" for notable Halo machinima from the past year, and [Bag Boy has been nominated](http://hawtymcbloggy.com/2008/12/29/2008-best-of-halo-awards-best-video-single-episode-non-montage/)! There are some other greats on the list as well, so browse, watch and [vote to your liking](http://hawtymcbloggy.com/2008/12/29/2008-best-of-halo-awards-best-video-single-episode-non-montage/).

I think it's about time you saw the first glimpse of Episode 3 of Season 2 of The Leet World. In true Counter-Strike:Source fashion, our dudes are battling it out in Inferno. We worked hard this weekend filming, and I'm excited about the results. Here are some screenies:

Enjoy.
