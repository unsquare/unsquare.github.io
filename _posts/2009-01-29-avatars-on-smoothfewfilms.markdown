[![gravatar](http://smoothfewfilms.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/01/gravatar.jpg)](http://smoothfewfilms.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/01/gravatar.jpg)I'm seeing lots of people with little ghost faces next to their names here, so I figured it was time for another update on how to add pictures to your profile at SmoothFewFilms.

The process is easy. Just go to [Gravatar and register for an account](http://en.gravatar.com/site/login) with the same e-mail address you used for this site, and you're good to go. Add a picture to your account there, and it should show up here and any other site that uses [Gravatar](http://www.gravatar.com/). It's seriously the easiest sign up process ever in the history of dude-kind.

It'd be nice to see some shiny new avatars for all of those comments on Season 2, Episode 4 of TLW, which will be here within the next couple of days.

Go forth and register, and be ye anonymous no more.
