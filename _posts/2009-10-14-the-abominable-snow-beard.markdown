![snow-yeti](http://smoothfewfilms.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/snow-yeti.jpg)Look at that. This is a first for Smooth Few Films, probably. Two episodes of content, two weeks in a row. So this is what it feels like to be on time for something. 

Anywho, the newest addition of Web Zeroes is now up for your enjoyment. In Episode 2, Ray convinces Nate to let him film a documentary about his day job, where he moonlights as a tech support specialist named the [Tech Yeti](http://smoothfewfilms.com/2009/10/13/tech-yeti/). Yes, there are beards involved. Also, handsome brown men. 

To download the episode or see higher res versions, head over to [Revision3](http://revision3.com/webzeroes/techyeti), or subscribe to Web Zeroes on [iTunes](http://itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewPodcast?id=335038421). We've actually been featured there in the "new and noteworthy" section under the podcasts. Cool stuff. 

Much thanks in advance to everyone who takes the time to watch this episode and leave a comment. Hit the jump to start watching. Episode 3 will be out next week on October 21st!

A few people have asked about "Bobby King", who does the commercial breaks. He is, in fact, Ty, who voiced Mendoza and Asher for The Leet World. Look forward to seeing more of him in Web Zeroes. A good bit more, actually.

Over the next week, I'm hoping to finally get to some Leet World content that I've been sitting on for awhile now. Mainly, some outtakes from the later episodes of Season 2, so be sure to check back here for updates on that.

But for now, watch the episode, comment and enjoy! As for me, I'm about to get my Uncharted 2 on.
