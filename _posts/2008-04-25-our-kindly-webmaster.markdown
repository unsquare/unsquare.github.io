Jeff (aka JJ or unsquare) does a whole bunch for Smooth Few Films. He's our good-hearted webmaster, an occasional guest writer for the series (he wrote [Episode Nine](http://www.smoothfewfilms.com/2008/02/01/satisfaction-guaranteed/)). and in general does a lot to keep this website functioning. Most of this community really wouldn't be possible without him. Today's his birthday, so I wanted to make a post and let all you guys wish him a happy one.

Thanks, Jeff, and happy birthday! Find yourself a good burro.
