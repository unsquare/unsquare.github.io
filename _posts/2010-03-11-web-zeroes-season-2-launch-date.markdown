Hello friends, dudes and trolls. I thought I would give an update about the status of Season 2 of Web Zeroes. Last we spoke, I said we didn't have an official release date nailed down yet, but we finally locked it up. The Season 2 premiere is going to release on Wednesday, March 24th. We're pretty excited about this, and we hope you guys are, too.

There will be a brief hiatus on production as we go out of town this weekend to hang out in Austin for South By Southwest. We'll be attending the live DiggNation filming on Saturday night at Stubb's, so if any of you guys live in Austin, are of age and want to drop by, please do. 

In other news, I saw this pretty slick [Modern Warfare 2 machinima](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHHBK6PGN8M), created by YouTube user [Michael Barnes](http://www.youtube.com/user/MichaelBarnes). He's done some Call of Duty 4 stuff as well as GTA 4 stuff, so I'd definitely recommend checking out the rest of his work as well. Anywho, give it a watch.
