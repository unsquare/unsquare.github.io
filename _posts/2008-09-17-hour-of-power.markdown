I don't have time for much of an update, but if you've been paying attention to US News at all, then you know that Hurricane Ike came through Houston and rocked the city. The storm pretty much came in and took a path of ownage straight to the area where Nick and I live.

We came through all right, no damage to our places, but neither of us have had power since Friday night, which was 3 days ago. Water just came back at my apartment last night, so that's good. We've been chilling with my brother, who was one of the first of 2.1 million people to get power back.

If you hadn't guessed, this kind of puts a damper on any immediate plans we had. It's not too big of a setback, it's just that Daniel couldn't come back in town when he planned, and it's delaying the filming of both GRIEF episode 1 and Web Zeroes as well. I also had a TLW related project I was going to work on over the weekend that's on hold indefinitely, though I plan on picking it back up once we have some electricity to work with.

In addition, the soundtrack is just about ready for release, but there are some finishing touches that also can't happen until you know, our city is functioning again. Anywho, once again, thanks for all the great comments on [Web Zeroes](http://www.smoothfewfilms.com/webzeroes/), we're really proud to have released it, and thanks for all the well wishes over the weekend.Â 

Also, if you haven't been to GamerSushi yet, I just put up an article today about some of [Halo's underrated qualities](http://gamersushi.com/2008/09/16/halo-haters-5-things-under-appreciated-about-halo/). Go join the discussion.
