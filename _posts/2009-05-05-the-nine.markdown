Thanks for the responses to Episode 8, [Hide and Sneak](http://smoothfewfilms.com/2009/04/30/hide-and-sneak/). Episode 9 will be out next week, and is about to enter the editing process via the bearded one himself, Nick. We're spending a lot more time putting the finishing touches on our episodes this season, and I really think it's shown so far. While he works on that, Daniel and I will be tag-teaming Episode 10, WWE style. There will be dropkicks, sirs.

The next few episodes dish out equal parts intrigue and answers. It might rule a little. Or at least, that's the hope. Anywho, here are some screenshots from the next episode, "Stranger in the House". Enjoy!

Also, the Houston Rockets and Star Trek are totally going to interfere with TLW this weekend, somehow. But I'm ok with that. Who else is seeing the movie?
