We'd like to introduce the first edition of [Know About It](http://smoothfewfilms.com/2009/03/07/know-about-it-spring-break/), the PSA series where Chet teaches you valuable life lessons. In this installment, our party animal discusses the many finer points of Spring Break, and how to survive it like a true bro-fessional.

Hopefully we get to do a few more PSA's just like this one in the near future. The idea of Chet being an expert on anything at all is kind of funny to us. And maybe just a little bit scary.

See the video after the jump!

Downloads coming in the next couple of days. The badass Know About It background will be available for download early next week, with Episode 6 hitting at some point as well. 

We've got a new [Rate Your Skill](http://gamersushi.com/2009/03/06/gamersushi-asks-rate-your-skill/) discussion going on at [GamerSushi](http://gamersushi.com/2009/03/06/gamersushi-asks-rate-your-skill/). Come check that out. Also, Daniel and I saw Watchmen last night, and kind of loved it. If you're a fan of comic book movies, you might just dig it.
