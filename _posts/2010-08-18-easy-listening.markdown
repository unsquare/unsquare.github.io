I apologize for the lack of updates. As you guys know, we're on kind of a break for a bit, enjoying some good books, movies, video games and the like. You know, normal life stuff. But as I said before, the creative fires won't be quelled for too long, and hopefully we can give you something on that front in a bit. You'll be the first to know. Or something like that.

Anyway, last post I promised some cool content, and I'm here to deliver. You may have noticed that we decided to take down the TLW Store a bit back, or maybe you didn't because you loathe stores of all kind. Either way, the TLW Soundtrack was being sold there for about two years running. Since so much time has passed, we thought we would be nice and give out a few of its tracks for free, starting with the TLW Theme Jam that you've heard on a couple of videos here and there. It's basically the normal Leet World theme, but with some extra sauce from Jace. Anyway, it's one of my favorite tracks on the album, so I hope you enjoy it.

In other news, who's seen Scott Pilgrim Vs. the World? I'm hearing fantastic things about it, and I can't wait to see it.
