![halo-wars](http://smoothfewfilms.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/04/halo-wars.jpg)Making a series like TLW takes a _crap-ton_ of time. So whenever we get a reprieve from the insanity of this absurd Counter-Strike: Source machinima, we tend to live it up. I've been playing a stupid amount of video games, particularly Halo Wars, Resident Evil 5, and some Killzone 2 for good measure. We even started up a game of D&D; with some friends, which I've never done before. Nick is a Dwarven Paladin named John Smotetrain, Daniel is an Avenger named Cortez Cardinal, and I'm a Wizard named Tom Shanks. We are questers of the most badass sort.

However, all that free time is gone as of this coming weekend, as we kick up production on Episode 8. We'll hopefully have a camera there filming the process as we move through some of the episode, and hope to release our "making of" video at some point in the next month or so. 

Speaking of, do you guys have any particular piece of the TLW production process that you're most interested in hearing about? Besides whether or not Nick's Beard (it must be capitalized out of honor) hinders our ability to puppeteer. Let us know!
