![Law and Order](http://smoothfewfilms.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/street-justice.jpg)We now proudly bring you the newest episode of Web Zeroes, Episode 19, [Street Justice](http://smoothfewfilms.com/2010/04/28/street-justice/). It is just a tad bueno, if I do say so myself. It also marks the halfway point of the season, so we're taking a 2 week break from releasing episodes to get caught up and take a slight breather.

In this episode, we see the dudes undergoing an investigation into the mystery of who's been secretly using their credit card. You'll quickly note that it's a slight departure from our normal style. As many of you know, we first envisioned Leet World as a Law and Order spoof. While that never quite panned out, it's an idea we kept in our back pocket and finally decided to unleash this season in WZ. Add in a little bit of CSI, a hobo, and some awesome music from [Jace Ford](http://www.twitter.com/jaceford/), and you have a fun combo. I think you'll especially like the intro.

Anyway, now that I've sufficiently built you up for disappointment, you should go ahead and hit the jump to see the episode. Go ahead. Jump. Like they do in Battlestar Galactica.

Head on over to [Revision3](http://www.revision3.com/webzeroes/streetjustice/) if you want to take this episode with you everywhere you go or just watch it til you're sick of it on your computer. 

Thanks for watching, and enjoy!
