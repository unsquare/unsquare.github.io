So, my brother just got back from Onicon and he told me that he saw some dudes there dressed as CS:S models. They had name tags on. Can anyone guess what the name tags said? The guy dressed as the arctic avenger... his said "Ellis", and another read "Ahmad". If you guys are reading this, send us some pics. We'd love to check them out.

On a personal note, this news is sort of awesome.
