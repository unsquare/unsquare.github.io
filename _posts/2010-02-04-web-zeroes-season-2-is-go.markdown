I know I said I'd update more, but my life is a bit of a mess right now, and I mean that in the absolute best way possible. Between work, writing for Web Zeroes, writing for GamerSushi, a powerful need to play Mass effect 2, doing some more personal writing, and my obsession with Lost's final season, I've been a tad MIA lately. 

However, the good news is that we started filming Season 2 of Web Zeroes last weekend, and so far, so good. I even brought some screenshots to prove it. I'm loving the look of the new footage we've shot on Daniel's sexy new Canon 7D. It's a great camera. Take a look and see for yourself.

We're going to start on Episode 2 this weekend, and will keep hitting the grind until sometime during the Summer. The show starts in March, so it's not too much longer before you guys will get to see what we're working on.

In the meantime, who's played Mass Effect 2? I kind of love it.
