This past Saturday, our beloved friend and resident editor extraordinaire Nick had himself a little birthday. Do wish him a happy one. He deserves it.

Anyone buying The Dark Knight on DVD/BluRay this week? Count me in for BluRay.

Our first [GamerSushi review](http://gamersushi.com/2008/12/08/gamersushi-review-saints-row-2/) is up. Go check it out!

Some cool stuff coming over the week. Stay tuned!
