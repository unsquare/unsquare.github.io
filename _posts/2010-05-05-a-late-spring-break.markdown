![Beach](http://smoothfewfilms.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/beach-horse.jpg)The horse picture has nothing to do with the post, but came up as one of the top results for "beach" on Google, which gave me a hearty _lulz_. So, there you have it.

As I mentioned last week, we are actually on something of a late Spring Break from releasing Web Zeroes for the next couple of weeks. That's not to say we aren't still working on the show, which we totally are. So it's not really much of a real break. How lame is that? Regardless of the nature of the break's lameness, **the show will resume on its normal release format on May 19th**, so hold on to your butts until that moment.

I say that things are "wild" all the time, so I'm trying to expand my vocabulary in that regard a bit, but it's shocking that we're half way through the second season. We're looking forward to getting the rest of it shot and delivered. It gets way more meta. Some won't like that, I don't think, but we are fans of meta things. Hell, Chet was always [Meta Guy](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MetaGuy?from=Main.MetaGirl) in Leet World.

In other random SFF related news, you may have missed the fact that we run a pretty awesome video game Web site known as [GamerSushi](http://www.gamersushi.com/). We've got a cool community over there, so come swing by. We just released our first podcast, too, which features SFF dudes Nick, JJ and myself. [Go check it out](http://gamersushi.com/2010/05/05/the-gamersushi-show-ep-1-very-important-conference-call/).

You also might have missed Daniel's appearance on [Film Riot](http://revision3.com/filmriot), another Revision3 show about film production and techniques. We shoot Web Zeroes on a Canon 7D DSLR. If you're unaware, DSLR filmmaking is kind of a hot topic right now, as it enables people to shoot high quality projects for a relatively low budget. Daniel gives a pretty cool breakdown of how we do our audio process for the show, so it's a nice behind-the-scenes look at Web Zeroes, if you're interested. Daniel appears at the 6:40 mark.
