Just thought I'd drop in with a few house-cleaning items. Work on Web Zeroes is progressing rather smoothly. Kind of weird seeing our faces on screen instead of silly dudes bobbing their heads and using radio commands.

We recorded some rather interesting things over the weekend that I think you all will enjoy, whenever it is that they come to fruition. And no, none of it is the commentary for Episode 3, unfortunately. We're going to have to wait on that for awhile until Daniel is back in town, as he's currently in the middle of a 6 week editing gig in Dallas. Yes, he's left us again. But our traveling editing minstrel will be back someday soon.

In addition, production on G.R.I.E.F. is about to go into full effect. It's a Halo 3 action/comedy series (emphasis on the action), and we're pretty pumped about moving forward on it. Hopefully you guys will be seeing a trailer for that at some point in the near future. In the meantime, enjoy these photos:
