The deadline for the [Streamy Award nominations](http://www.streamys.org/submit/public-submissions/) is rapidly approaching. Faster than the hair grows on Nick's face, even. Terrifying, right? Well don't let the fear paralyze you, stand up and vote for Web Zeroes. The deadline is this Friday, January 15th, and you can vote every single day until then. Every vote counts, and we seriously appreciate the support. If you've forgotten, I put up a [voting guide for Web Zeroes](http://smoothfewfilms.com/2009/12/19/vote-web-zeroes-for-the-streamy-awards/) so you guys can help us out.

Writing has officially begun on Web Zeroes, Season 2. We had an awesome planning session recently and I must say, this season gets meta as all hell. I'm looking forward to it. Hopefully you guys are, too.

In other news, we are considering picking up the podcast-ing again. You guys should submit some topics you'd like to hear us discuss or things you're curious about in our world of content creation. Maybe we'll talk about them. Or not. Either way, let us know!

Also, I'm not sure how many of you have seen the Source filmmaker tests that have been leaked from the TF2 beta. From what I hear, it could really change the way Source machinima is done. It eliminates the need for actors and renders some pretty cool effects in real-time. That sure would have been helpful a few years ago, Valve, but maybe it'll see the light of day at some point. I doubt it, but folks can dream, can't they? Anyway, here's a cool Team Fortress 2 test I saw the other day:
