Filming for Episode Ten has begun as of this week and so far things are on schedule.  It's nice to be back in the habit of making the show after so long away from it.  Over the break we had a chance to iron out some plot issues, and figure out some things that worked and didn't work as far as our pacing went for the first half of the season.  I think the end result will be that this half feels smoother, more concise, and just better.  Here are some screenshots from Episode Ten:

Stay tuned for more extras that you won't want to miss.  There might even be a new short waiting around the corner...
