We are ever plodding away at filming the last two episodes of the second season, and boy are we feeling it. Getting through any season of material is tough work, and by the time you're at the end of it, it almost seems like it will never end. Lucky for us, this isn't our first rodeo, so we are wrangling and breaking this thing like a Hungarian Halfbred in Red Dead Redemption. Maybe I should have prefaced that last sentence with "nerd alert". Oh well, too late.

Anyway, over the last week or so, I've seen a couple of cool things I wanted to share here. The first of these is from a machinima series we've linked to before, called [Forecast](http://forecasttheseries.blogspot.com/). Their first season ranks as some of my favorite Halo work, so that's why I'm excited about the trailer for Forecast season 2, which you should watch.



In addition, [BlackwatchFilms](http://www.youtube.com/user/BlackwatchFilms) has mocked up a pretty cool thing that we've taken a liking to lately. He mashed up Web Zeroes clips with the intro theme of the Office, which works surprisingly well together. As a long time fan of the show, it's awesome to see, and he did a good job with the right cilps.
