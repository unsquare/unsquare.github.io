I know I've said it before, but the general rule around here is that the more busy we are, the quieter we tend to be. Coming up on the twelfth episode of Season 2 is no exception. With Daniel still out of town and gallivanting around movie sets like some cinema cowboy, we're left scrambling to finish the season. But it's a good kind of scramble. Like eggs.

It's hard to believe there are just a couple more episodes left, but that's the way we roll, I guess. Thanks to you dudes that have stuck it out so far for this absurd machinima. Anywho, here are some screenshots from the next episode.

That last one is a major tease, am I right?
