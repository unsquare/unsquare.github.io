Texas Summers are like living on some distant star. The boiling, the heat, the humidity (for us Houstonians, anyway)... it just wears a man down to his bones, or whatever other endoskeleton that is used to construct geeks like ourselves. In the midst of all of that, we're still toiling away at the final episode of TLW, one scene at a time.

Some of you may have noticed that there's been a bit of radio silence for the last few weeks. There are a few reasons for that. Part of it is that there has been some vacationing going on, and another is something that we hope to tell you about soon. Still another part is that Episode 14 is the Godzilla of episodes. It is _obese_. All others bow before it. That hyperbole simply means that it is big.

I'd say we've got about a third of it left to film, but it's the hard third (_that's what she said_), so take that with a grain of salt. When we're nearing about a week from release, we'll let you know. It's not that time yet, good sirs.

Maybe these screenshots will tide you over, but probably not.

Feel free to speculate. Thanks for sticking around to see this thing through with us, dudes. You're kind of awesome in that way.
