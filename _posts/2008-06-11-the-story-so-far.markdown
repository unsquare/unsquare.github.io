And a glimpse of what is on the horizon. Daniel spent some time putting this recap of Season One together, to see where the show has come from and the kind of ground that our characters have covered. While we didn't have time to hit every single thing, we wanted to touch on the most important aspects of the story as it relates to the Season Finale.

Stay until the end, and you'll even get a sneak peek not only of what is to come in the Season Finale, but also a window into the release.
