A "Happy Memorial Day" is in order, I suppose. I think all weekends should be 3 days long by some kind of new Earth law. Also, all burritos should be at least a foot in length. I'd be good at boss-ing the world.

Our next update will have some tantalizing details about the Season Finale. Also, forecasting a high chance of lulz later this week. On to more immediate matters, though.

The entry deadline for the Themetacular Challenge has now passed and the finalists have been chosen. If you weren't aware, the Themetacular Challenge is our first official contest, where fans submit original covers of The Leet World theme. The winning entry will be played during the intro of the Season Finale.

Overall, we're proud of the response we've gotten from our community. It was definitely a treat to hear some of the stuff you guys came up with- who knew that so much could be derived from a goofy (but cool) intro themetune?

Read on to hear the finalists and the honorable mentions.

**Honorable Mention**

These were songs that we appreciated the effort on, but for one reason or another didn't quite make the cut. One entry makes it just for being hilarious.

Jace (Damn Dangerous) also submitted a false entry under a different name that happened to be one of my personal favorites. I later found out that it was made of not only win, but epic lies. Thanks for breaking my heart, Jace. You guys will be hearing that one at a later date. Actually, you've already heard it. Kind of.

**Finalists**

These entries represent what we felt to be the cream of the crop, mainly based on creativity and originality. Give each one of them a listen.

[ChrisTeen]([http://www.smoothfewfilms.com/audio/contest/finalists/tlwcontest_ChrisTeen.mp3)- Great use of the theme underneath a pretty cool beat.

[DJ Shox](http://www.smoothfewfilms.com/audio/contest/finalists/tlwcontest_DJShox.mp3)- This just makes you want to dance, huh?

[Lars Erik Fjosne](http://www.smoothfewfilms.com/audio/contest/finalists/tlwcontest_LarsErikFjosne.mp3)- Every time this tune erupts into celebration half way through, I want to party.

[John Kozera](http://www.smoothfewfilms.com/audio/contest/finalists/tlwcontest__JohnKozera.mp3)- Simply the best of our live recorded entries and one of the more original takes on the theme in the contest.
