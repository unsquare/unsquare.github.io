![magnifying-glass](http://smoothfewfilms.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/magnifying-glass.jpg)Thanks for all of the feedback on Episode 1 of Web Zeroes. We're looking forward to the release of Episode 2 on Wednesday. It's hard to believe that we've already shot 7 of those things, and I'm writing the 8th for this upcoming weekend. The whole thing has been a crazy learning process for all of us at SFF, and hopefully you guys stick with us through it.

I was thinking the other day about The Leet World and doing a bit of reflecting on the Counter-Strike machinima that was, and I remembered some cool pieces of commentary that I've been wanting to share with you guys. Normally, this kind of stuff would come up in a podcast, but as we haven't had any time to ourselves lately, I thought it'd be good to go ahead and post it. 

Here are some lost TLW factoids for you to nom on.



	
  * _Player was originally going to be a girl_. Yes, how very Spriggs (and Red vs Blue, come to think of it) of us. I'm not sure when the decision was made. Somewhere in the middle of making the first episode, we felt that if Player ever got a voice, the voice would have to be funnier than what he already was. We decided we could never top him as he has always existed in the show, so he stayed voiceless and male-_ish_.






	
  * _Asher's original name was Jenkins. _As many have surmised, Leeroy, the World of Battlelore player extraordinaire, was named after Leeroy Jenkins. As even more of a nod to the classic video, we were going to name Asher as "Jenkins". We eventually changed this idea so that people wouldn't start assuming that Leeroy and Asher were twins, seeing as how they shared the same model. Asher's actual name is a reference to Ash, the android in Ripley Scott's Alien.






	
  * _Westheimer was going to be Chet's father. _This is one that I'm still kind of sad we ditched. For whatever reason, we chunked it by the end of season 1, but Westheimer was intended to be Chet's father. This adds even extra humor to Chet's lamentation in Episode 5 about never knowing his father.






	
  * _Ahmad's original murderer? The Producer. _After Asher detonated (inside the warehouse instead of outside), the gang was going to leave the burning building behind, assuming Ahmad's demise was inevitable. He is eventually found by the Producer and some Noonien soldiers. Ahmad reaches to the Producer for help and is shocked when Prod pulls out a silenced pistol, executing him amidst the rubble of de_nuke. The Producer simply walks away, ordering the soldiers to "Clean up this mess". As awesome as this would have been, it was just a little bit too brutal and far less heroic for our lovable noob.



There are plenty more where those came from. Feel free to send in your questions about The Leet World, I'd love to give out more information like this. And come back on Wednesday for more Web Zeroes!
