Nick was out of town for the weekend, Daniel had work and I was sick as a dog, but all-in-all, great things still happened on the progress of Episode Twelve. Daniel and I put in an 8 hour day on Saturday and made some stuff happen. There will be some more news in a few days about when you can expect the episode, so I'm sure you're all ready to hear that. This episode is a big one, that's for sure.

Also, today's Daniel's birthday. He's old. Not really.

Like I said before, I was pleased with how everyone responded to [Ahmad's Biography](http://www.smoothfewfilms.com/2008/04/08/ahmad-a-noobs-story/) last week. Hopefully, this week will be no different. Our next stop on the biography tour is Leeroy.

Some of Leeroy's earliest memories revolve around being able to hold a Sega Genesis controller in his chubby infant hands. While it was his father's hobby, Leeroy often watched the colorful sprites zip around the television screen, fascinated by the way the little black plastic system could render the action that he was witnessing. His father, the computer programmer, an anti-social recluse himself, was eager to have something which would provide a bond between him and his offspring. He pushed the controlling apparatus for each gaming system into Leeroy's hands one after the other, nursing a father-son pastime into something that would one day become an obsession.

The day that changed Leeroy's life forever was the first day he experienced the joy of operating a keyboard and a mouse to kill computerized minions. With early 90's titles like _Wolfenstein 3D_, _Doom_ and _Duke Nukem_, Leeroy soon abandoned the consoles for more civilized gaming ventures. With the help of his father, Leeroy assembled his first gargantuan gaming rig at 10 years old in anticipation of the release of _Quake II_. Soon enough, he was participating in the modding community, much to his father's delight.

Leeroy's love for modding and manipulating his favorite PC games easily translated over into other software. He began running multiple OS's on a number of computers, writing programs, initiating protocols and all kinds of other technical jargon. Once the internet was introduced into his life, the young boy was surfing everywhere, gaining access to whatever he could, seeking more knowledge than he ever thought possible. And more cyber roleplay than he could have ever hoped for.

Beyond playing his first PC game, the second most momentous occasion of young Leeroy's life occurred in the summer before his freshman year of high school, where he experienced his new love: Dungeons and Dragons. By the time he was 15, Leeroy was his school's most renowned DM. His superb imagination combined with his love for fantasy made people feel that his stories were coming alive. Plus, he wore costumes.

At 17, Leeroy graduated early from high school after selling a program to several school districts that allowed them to integrate attendance programs with their online gradebooks. Using a backdoor into this process, Leeroy sold other students a chance to look at their grades, and for a small fee, he would change them. The gifted youngster was accepted into MIT after graduation— and that's where fate took its turn.

When Leeroy was 18, something horrible and wonderful happened. Frigid Entertainment released its momentous MMORPG, _World of Battlelore_. Combining the two loves of Leeroy's life, fantasy and gaming, the computer wiz was transformed into a shell of his former self. Using his beloved Wood Elf character, Leeroy rallied guilds and legions of fans, becoming the number 1 wood elf for his entire server. Forum posts were written, internet memes created, all while Leeroy's grades fell off due to his lack of studies. It was there that he met his girlfriend, 22 year old Glrydmersh (can we buy a vowel please) from the Proddenia server.

Leeroy soon failed out of MIT with a terrible addiction to World of Battlelore and thousands of dollars left to pay in school fees. With nowhere else to turn, Leeroy had to enter the workforce. While working as a cubicle monkey in his first job, Leeroy was caught hacking into a government agency's network— he was given a job in their counter-terrorism unit one week later. He primarily worked on communications analysis and did the occasional stakeout, managing to stay out of all of the action. Then one day, Leeroy saw an ad for The Leet World come across his desk. Beaten down by the long hours and his tremendous school debt, this new reality show could be the chance of a lifetime— the chance to put everything back together.
