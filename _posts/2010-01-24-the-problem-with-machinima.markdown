![Machinima](http://smoothfewfilms.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/machinima.jpg)Last year, as many of you know, we announced the end of the Leet World. At the time, we cited several reasons, one of them being our confirmation that Valve was not interested in machinima in the slightest. While we couldn't go into the details of how we knew this to be true, it seems that another machinima studio has done so.

[Pixel Eyes Productions](http://pixeleyesproductions.com/) are the creators of the well known [Shelf Life](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NWB72My5_c) machinima, using the Source engine. Recently, they've gone through some of the same issues we had in terms of trying to monetize their (hour intensive) hobby, and came up with similar results. We just assumed not talk about the problems we had, but it seems they have done so. This includes their issues with trying to become YouTube sponsors, where they were denied, just like us, since they don't own the rights to the Source machinima they produced. Naturally, Valve owns those.

More interestingly than the YouTube dilemma, though, was that they (like us) pursued the securing of these rights from Valve, via a commercial machinima license of some kind. And, they have posted the official response. Which, just as we insisted all those many months ago, was simply that [Valve is not interested in machinima](http://pixeleyesproductions.blogspot.com/2009/12/valve-is-not-interested-in-machinima.html). 

If you don't feel like clicking on the link, here's the short of Valve's response.



> We are not interested in licensing our technology or IP for machinima. This includes providing copyright approvals.



I have to say, I really feel for Pixel Eyes, having been in their shoes just last year. If you are a young filmmaker trying to use Valve's excellent Source tools, they have essentially shut the door with statements just like that. While I don't blame Valve for trying to protect their property in the slightest, it certainly is a shame to see them take such a hard line stance when it comes to something their community produces so readily and in many cases excellently. 

To me, it's stances like these that will keep machinima in kind of a stale flux for many years to come. What you are starting to see is that the more talented individuals get snatched out of making machinima and onto other things, because machinima runs into more dead ends than it does opportunities. While it's a nice low-budget way to practice something you love doing, making money off of it is often times the exception and not the rule. And this extends beyond machinima even, to any kind of derivative content.  

My advice for any hobbyists out there that like to dabble in machinima or other forms of derivative content (fan fiction, stories based on popular games or movies, comic strips that do the same, etc) is that if you want to do this stuff for a living, don't spend all your time on something you don't own. By all means, practice your craft with machinima and use it to gain a fanbase, but let that be only a supplement to a project that you own completely, and let that be where you sink most of your time into. 

Trust me, in the long run, it'll be worth it. You don't want to spend years of your life working on something only to be told that it doesn't really belong to you in the end. Sure, you gained lots of experience and you had fun doing what you loved, but if you can do all that and then use it to pay the bills, it's a double bonus. And believe me, if you're good, somebody somewhere will want to pay for what it is that you're kicking ass on. 

So go out there and make it happen.
