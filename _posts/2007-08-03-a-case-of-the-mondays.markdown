Good news!

After getting together and watching a new cut of Episode 1, we've decided that we will launch our website and first episode this coming Monday, August 6th.  We've been planning on this date for awhile, but now we know that we can hit it successfully.

On Sunday night/ Monday morning, this blogspot will redirect you to www.smoothfewfilms.com, where you can find the link to the episode.  It will be available in a variety of sizes, which is sure to please both the Hi Def and ipod lovers alike.  Keep spreading the word about The Leet World, and remember, go sign up for [our forum](http://www.smoothfewfilms.com/forum) until then!
