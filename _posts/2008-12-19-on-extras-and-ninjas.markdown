Like ninjas, we plan on giving some long overdue extra content in the next few weeks. I know that some of you are longing for a podcast, and believe me, we have been too. It was sad for us that we never got to record a season finale podcast to wrap up and tell tales of that huge finale and what went into it. But soon, you'll be hearing a lot of that stuff.

Speaking of extras, check out our new feature at GamerSushi, [Shattered Save Slots](http://gamersushi.com/2008/12/19/shattered-save-slots-final-
fantasy-vii/), where we tackle some of our favorite games. This week is Final Fantasy VII. 

Also, outtakes are on the way. There's some pretty good stuff from the first couple of episodes, and possibly even more Cortez Cardinal: Ace Attorney in there as well.

Here are some screenshots from Episode 3 of Web Zeroes. We got some great footage last weekend. I think this is going to be a pretty solid episode.

You know what else is full of ninjas? Christmas. Who knew it was next week? It came like a thief in the shadows. Next time, I'll be ready.
