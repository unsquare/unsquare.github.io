I don't care if you're a Harry Potter fan or not, this trailer is awesome. Very curious about where they're going to be splitting this movie in two. Any guesses?



In other news, one of my favorite Halo 3 machinimas, Forecast: The Series has resumed with the [premiere of Season 2](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNR060QKWnI). Check it out!
