Apparently, we were recently mentioned on [GamesRadar](http://www.gamesradar.com) as the number two Halo 3 Machinima directors on the web. It's a great review, and they have a lot of cool things to say about our work in the Halo engine. It seems that if we had done more, we might have snagged first place. To check out the article and see some other cool Halo stuff, read up on it at the [Machinima Academy Awards](http://www.gamesradar.com/f/haloradar-machinima-academy-awards/a-20080306162910798001). They even mention The Leet World series. It's fun to see this kind of press, especially considering that Smooth Few Films was also mentioned in the April issue of Electronic Gaming Monthly for ["A Day in the Life of a Turret"](http://www.smoothfewfilms.com/2008/01/18/portal-a-day-in-the-life-of-a-turret-2/). Much thanks to the [1Up crew](http://www.1up.com) for that nod.

We are still toiling mightily on Episode Eleven, making a Herculean effort to get it out as soon as possible. There's a delicate balance between working efficiently, quickly, but not rushing it to the point that you're hurting the end product. So far, we're happy with where the episode sits, and we're nearing the finish line.

As always, we'll let you know when we're on the "eve" of release- we'll be there any day now. Below are a few more screenshots from the episode.

More extras are on the way as well, including a little message from a couple of your beloved characters. Stay tuned!

Edit: Apparently, we were also noted in the UK [PC Gamer](http://www.pcgamer.com). Thanks for the heads up guys!
