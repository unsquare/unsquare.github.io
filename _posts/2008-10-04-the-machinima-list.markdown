As some of you know, we were nominated for some awards recently. Well, the machinima lords and lasses have handed down the full list of [2008 Machinima Filmfest Nominees](http://festival.machinima.org/wordpress/?page_id=17), so go ahead and get your browsing on. There are a few good pieces on there- some of it I had seen, some of it was new to me.

Notable among those are several nominations for our friends over at [Lit Fuse](http://www.litfusefilms.com/), a fun short called World of Workcraft that combines cs_office with WoW, and a cinematography nomination for [TheDuoGroup](http://www.theduogroup.com/). If you're unfamiliar with that last one, you need to check out [Without Providence](http://www.theduogroup.com/blog/?p=390), which has some stunning visuals for a Halo short. Big fan of their work. Great stuff.
