A close look at the first screenshots from Episode Eleven will more than likely reveal the location of the next challenge.  Thought you guys might like the answer to that particular question.  We've been excited about this episode for awhile, and we really think you guys will have fun with it.  From our website statistics, it's apparent that Episodes 4 and 8 are the most viewed, and we're guessing it's because of all the shooting and explosions.  Rest assured, you will have plenty of those in our next installment.

Screenshots are below.
