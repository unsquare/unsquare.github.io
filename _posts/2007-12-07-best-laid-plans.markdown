All is still going well on the production of Episode Eight.  I've even brought some screenshots, as an early holiday gift.  I'm pretty generous like that.  If you couldn't tell from the last episode, there will be some major poo going down.

Episode Eight will be our mid-season "finale", marking the halfway point of our first season of The Leet World.  We'll be taking a break after its release for about a month or so, in order to gear up for the second half of the season and really do some solid work for the next batch of episodes.  In that time that we take off, there will still be a lot to keep you guys coming back though, so don't worry.  There will be plenty of extras (a Christmas present, perhaps?), as well as a look into some other things that we're getting our hands in right now, including an upcoming Halo 3 short.   That break should give you guys plenty to look forward to as far as the show goes, that's for sure.
