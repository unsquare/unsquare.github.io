[![oldtv](http://smoothfewfilms.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/02/oldtv.jpg)](http://smoothfewfilms.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/02/oldtv.jpg)We here at Smooth Few Films are huge television fans, if you haven't been able to gather that from podcasts, comments, or even bits and pieces of content you've seen in our videos. Personally, I gobble up TV shows like nobody's business, and I'm following way too many to keep track of at the moment. My DVR is swollen and burning with righteous indignation at the suffering I've put it through recording Lost, House, 24 and Battlestar Galactica, to name a few.

Anywho, I say all of that because our love for TV no doubt reflects in The Leet World. Apparently, some very observant viewer thought enough of the show to put up a [Leet World page on TV Tropes](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheLeetWorld). Listed in the article are several recurring themes from the wide terrain of television that have made their way into our goofy Counter-Strike:Source machinima. They range from the ["Big No"](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigNo) to the ["Handicapped Badass"](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HandicappedBadass) themes that we use.

The funny thing is, most of these are intentional on our parts, but some of them actually aren't, which just means that they've been ingrained into our psyche as creative TV watchers. Anywho, it's a really cool analysis of The Leet World, and if you click on each of the tropes, you can find more specific examples and analysis given about the show more in-depth. 

This is probably one of the coolest things a fan has written about what we make, and it really made our day to see it. It's cool to see someone recognize all the layers that are actually going on with the characters. We really do put a lot of effort into that. So to whoever did it, lots of thanks.

In other news, we've got a TLW short coming next week that I think you guys will dig. Stay tuned! By the way, what are your favorite TV shows?
