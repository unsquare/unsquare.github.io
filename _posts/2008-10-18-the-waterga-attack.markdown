I told you guys I would post about the crazy flooding that happened in my apartment the other night. Basically, the water heater exploded and dumped water all throughout the living room, the bedroom, etc.

Luckily, it didn't quite make it all the way back to the spare bedroom, where all of our equipment resides, but it got pretty darn close. The padding and carpet had to be torn out so it could dry, and my wife and I had to move all of the furniture to any spot that was dry.

You should recognize some of this stuff because it's where we film Web Zeroes. Here are some pics:

Anywho, things are mostly back to normal, though he haven't moved our furniture back yet. It also managed not to slow down production, as Nick and I are busily editing audio for the first 3 episodes of Season 2. Filming starts this next week.
