Just wanted to throw up a quick nod to a few notable machinima releases. For one, [LitFuseFilms](http://www.litfusefilms.com) debuted a new movie/companion piece called [Jill's Song](http://litfusefilms.com/movies/jillssong/). It's definitely a departure from their normal stuff as well as machinima in general and it features some incredible faceposing to accompany a brilliant vocal performance from Ricky Grove. Go watch! Also, [vote for their film "Dennis"](http://www.bitfilm.com/festival/member.php?page=fd&fid=2169&id=111459&category_token=MA) in the BitFilm contest.

Likewise, [RoosterTeeth](http://www.roosterteeth.com) released the first episode of their new Red Vs Blue series, [Reconstruction](http://rvb.roosterteeth.com/viewEntry.php?id=695). Definitely an entertaining watch, I completely forgot I was viewing a Halo machinima.

Towards the beginning, you'll see an impressive big army shot that Smooth Few Films was able to assist with when we visited RoosterTeeth in Austin, due to skillful (not really) puppetry by Daniel, Nick and myself. Listen closely in the shot that follows, and you might hear a familiar voice...

Some Season Finale details and screenshots are coming tonight/tomorrow.

Voting for the Themetacular Challenge ends next week- [go vote](http://www.smoothfewfilms.com/2008/05/26/themetacular-voting-begins/)!
