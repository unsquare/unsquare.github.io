Congratulations are in order for our favorite noobito, Ahmad.

Or rather, our friend Ben, the voice actor who plays him. Earlier this week, Ben became a proud father. His son was born on Monday, December 22nd- just in time for Christmas.

We here at Smooth Few Films just wanted to say a heartfelt congratulations to Ben and his wife. Many blessings, Ben. You are one of the coolest dudes I know. In a nerdy way, of course.
