Well, I know it's been a long wait, but "[Episode Four: Dust 2 Dust](http://www.smoothfewfilms.com/2007/09/28/dust-2-dust/)" is finally here.  This episode took a little longer for several reasons: 1) Daniel was out of town for a week, 2) one of our computers (mine) no longer runs Steam, so we're down an "actor", and 3) we wanted this episode to be the best it could be, so we pushed it back a couple of days to continue to work on it.  Typically, we will be releasing every two weeks, and this last wait (which was three weeks plus a few days) will be about as long as they come.

The end result of all of that is an episode we've worked pretty hard on, so we hope that you all enjoy it.  Anyone that's played a match of CSS (or any online game for that matter) should get a kick out of it.

Also, Halo 3 had very little to do with the delay.  Although, it held up our music a little.  Just a little.

Enjoy!
