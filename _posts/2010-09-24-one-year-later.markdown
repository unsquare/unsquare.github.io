Well, it passed. Leet World ended just a little over a year ago. A nutty show, and a nutty ride. You guys are nuts, too. 

I'd write a big thing about my thoughts about the year since, but I'd rather hear more of what you guys think. What are some of the highlights and lowlights of you for TLW? I've got a few of my own.

**Highlights:** Mendoza's arc. Both season finales. The "can of worms / Council of Elrond" episode, S2E11, where most of the mysteries were spilled (still feel like we pulled that off decently). S1E7, because I feel like it was the first episode where we "got it" and the formula and quality for all subsequent episodes clicked.

**Lowlights:** I know a lot of people will boo me for this, but S1E1. The fact that we introduced Mendoza so late. Probably the only true "filler" episode we did, S1E6. The faceposing in Season 1. Not having the time to utilize the comrades/SWAT Bras more fully. 

Go ahead and share yours.

In other news, we've been told from a Canadian friend that Day in the Life of a Turret was shown/referenced on TV there. While we're unsure of the network (though it might have been G4), it seems the context wasn't entirely positive. Still, we're curious if anyone saw this?

Also, if you were planning on checking out Daniel's panel appearance on [Rooster Teeth's Best of Machinima Panel](http://smoothfewfilms.com/2010/09/16/fantastic-fest-plus-rocking-with-the-producer/) this weekend at Fantastic Fest, that has been officially moved to Sunday at 2:30 PM. This is a bummer for me, because I was going to drive down for it on Saturday, but now I can't. Sad. Face.
